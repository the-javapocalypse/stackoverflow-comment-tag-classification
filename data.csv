element won t center  i created a carousel with the following html code   <pre><code>&lt;div id= projcarousel &gt;    &lt;div class= active &gt;        &lt;a href= http://www.#.com  target= _blank &gt;#&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;img id= projimg  src= img/#.png  class= active  /&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div&gt;        &lt;a href= http://www.#.com  target= _blank &gt;#&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;img id= projimg  src= img/#.png  /&gt;    &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   i noticed that the #projcarousel div a were not centering. i did some searching and found that the proper way to center a element would be with the css   <pre><code>#projcarousel div a {    margin-left:auto;    margin-right:auto; } </code></pre>   i ve tried multiple things and narrowed down that the problem is either with me using the position:relative or display:inline. i am not sure what the exact problem is with using the two together like this. does anyone have any advice on why its not working. this is the css i am currently using for the carousel.   <pre><code>#projcarousel {   margin: 0px;   padding: 0px;   position: absolute;   min-height: 100%;   min-width:100%; }  #projimg {  width:100%;  height: auto;  margin-top: -24px; }  #projcarousel div {  padding: 0px;  margin: 0px;  position:absolute;  min-width:100%;  min-height: 100% }  #projcarousel div a {   position: relative;   top: 100px;   left: 44.5%;   padding: 20px;   border: 10px solid rgba(255  255  255  .6);   font-size: 20px;       display: inline;   text-decoration: none;   text-align: center;  width: 200px; } </code></pre>   on a side note  i thought it might be easier to just remove the  tags altogether and just use    <pre><code>  background-image:url(img/#.png); </code></pre>   but that does not want to work either. sorry about all the text.,css
.net based class library - many ways to do a specific task - what are the top x vs y articles and books  very few books and articles ever go into detail about a) why multiple methods are provided to complete a specific task in a specific scenario and b) what considerations a developer should take when choosing between methods.    my specific case in point is the simple opening of a text file (classic first section of any io chapter).  most books/articles just say  hey  here s how to open a text file: streamreader with file path. tada and end of section!     some do at least list the fact that there are multiple classes that allow you to do this e.g:   <ul> <li>file class</li> <li>fileinfo class</li> <li>filestream class</li> <li>streamreader class</li> <li>etc  etc  etc</li> </ul>   fewer discuss that there are even more overloads so you can use each class in several different ways.    even fewer even try to enter into any discussion about how to select the best method for the task at hand.  (some of course do and these are the ones that usually end up in the top three when someone posts a poll-like question about  best  books.)    this lack of discussion drives me mad.  i feel like i should toss a coin.    this question has the joint purposes of:   <ul> <li>finding out if anyone thinks this is a worthwhile topic in the first place</li> <li>offering people an opportunity to list any interesting articles or books that specifically go into these kinds of discussions</li> </ul>   i ve made this a wiki because other similar questions were made into wikis.  and if people feel this question has no merit  i apologize and feel free to vote it closed.    <strong>another example</strong>    i am currently reading about binarywriter and binaryreader.  the last 20 articles i have hit using google and at least 5 books on o reilly safari have shown me how to write a single integer and read it back.  a couple included an example of how to use writestring and readstring.  exactly one let me know that writestring() and readstring() use a special encdoding meaning if you do writestring() and readchar() you get a prefix.  there are lots of ways to use these classes.  why do hardly any articles discuss this     <strong>one more</strong>    another example of what i mean is when a book or article lists class members and descriptions word for word from msdn without adding any value.  i do not need a list of class members because i can get that from msdn.  from an author  i need experience  real world knowledge i.e. stuff that will expand me as a developer.  not stuff i can look up in five seconds.  all the member lists and simple i-don t-do-anything-useful examples in the world aren t going to really help anyone who wants to learn their stuff.    <strong>last one - i promise</strong>    just reading about stringwriter and stringreader.  same thing.  lots of articles and books giving simple i-don t-do-anything-useful examples.  some at least say something vague like i may want to use stringwriter if i want to write characters to an underlying buffer.  how would i know if i want to do that   what real world scenarios would require it   i could go on all night.    <strong>ok so i lied...</strong>    <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/668361/fastest-implementation-of-a-true-random-number-generator-in-c >this question</a> has answers from merhdad and jalf that both explain how you would choose between two methods of generating a random number and demonstrates (i think) the kind of information i am talking about.  jalf says  something along the lines of  in most cases use option a. but in this specific case when you are trying to achieve result x  use option b. and by the way  this will have negative effect m.     <strong>x vs y articles</strong>    i figured out i can get what i want by searching for x vs y articles e.g. <a href= http://www.aspfree.com/c/a/c-sharp/a-look-at-c-sharp-directory-and-directoryinfo-classes/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >this one</a> that discusses how to choose between the directory and directoryinfo classes (and file and fileinfo classes).      so now this question is:    can you list any useful x vs y articles,.net

graph implementation  i need to create a graph implementation from input files of the type formatted below where s will be the starting node from which i will implement a number of search algorithms. my question is how i turn this into a graph  right now i have written code to read the input file into an array of strings (w/ each input into the array being a line of the maze).    i was thinking i would then just find the starting node (where s is) and start building outward as i implement the search. is this a better approach then creating all the nodes at the start  i will be using python.,python

what s the best way for an angular controller to alter an ancestor html element   i have an angular controller which lives in a portion of the page however that application needs to get access to an html element that lives above it.     the best way to imagine the problem is that you have an embedded video which wants to request to be made full view-port:   <pre><code>&lt;html ng-app= videoapp &gt;    &lt;body&gt;      &lt;div&gt;       other stuff that doesn t relate to the video player...     &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div ng-controller= videoctrl &gt;       ... stuff relating to the video controller     &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>   the exact problem is that the <code>videoctrl</code> needs to be able to add a class to the body class such that it can switch the page layout to being full-page and dominated by the video.    <em>desired outcome  status of video app adds a  full-page  class to body tag:</em>   <pre><code>&lt;body ng-class= video.fullpage    full-page   :    &gt; </code></pre>  <h2>what s would be the correct way for the video to add a class to an ancestor tag </h2>   under normal circumstances where the element we want to manipulate lies inside the controller that s doing the manipulation we can bind elements to variables in the scope:   <pre><code>&lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- the videoctrl scope is not available to &lt;body&gt; --&gt;   &lt;div ng-controller= videoctrl &gt;     &lt;div ng-class= video.fullpage    fullpage  :    &gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; </code></pre>   however the body tag is not contained within the scope of the video controller and so has no access to the variables in its scope so we can t bind to them.    we could always reach out directly and change the class on the body using dom manipulation but that s not very <em>angular</em>. what is the correct pattern for the video controller to alter the class of the body tag,angularjs
convert short bits into an int  i have a tcp packet that sends a bunch of unsigned variables (they are unsigned because they are saving space and using the limits for unique ids)  i need to convert this unsigned short bit data into an integer in java.    so my question is how do i convert bytearray[0 - 15] into an int      edit:    here is the code i have changed to:   <pre><code>byteorder order = byteorder.big_endian; requesteddatetype = new biginteger(bytebuffer.allocate(2).put(data  8  2).order(order).array()).intvalue(); </code></pre>   the data buffer coming in is:   <pre><code>bit   0    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  value 40   0   0   0   8   0   0   0   1   0 </code></pre>   the data is sent as little endian. i assume since biginteger assumes big  i need to convert to that. however both big or little order give me the same value in return.    i expect to get 1 for the value of <code>requesteddatetype</code> however i am getting 256. how do i pad the two missing bytes to make sure it gives me 0000 0000 0000 0001 instead of 0000 0001 0000 0000     edit 2:    never mind. changed code to this:   <pre><code>bytebuffer bb = bytebuffer.allocate(2); bb.order(byteorder.little_endian); bb.put(data  8  2); int value = ((int)bb.getshort(0)) &amp; 0xff; </code></pre>,java

c# random seed generator of multiple instances  i m making a simple game to improve my c# skills. i read about the random() class and how it generates a seed off of datetime and found some results of how to get a pseudorandom generator from one instance.    player class:   <pre><code>    random dice = new random();     public int rolldice()     {         int dice1 = dice.next(1  7);         int dice2 = dice.next(1  7);         int sum = dice1 + dice2;         console.writeline( d1:   + dice1 +   d2:   + dice2 +   sum:   + sum);         return sum;     } </code></pre>   main:   <pre><code>//infiniteloop{       player1.rolldice();       console.readkey();       player2.rolldice();   } </code></pre>   upon output  no longer how long i wait to press the key and re-call the player2.diceroll() it still will roll the same numbers. if i only have one player  it works perfectly. how can i improve this,c#

do until loop won t exit  this must be a silly question but with my logic i can t understand why it doesn t exit. this is my loop:   <pre><code>random _random = new random(); int num; char let; string tempname =  ~ ; string stemppath; do {     while (tempname.length &lt; 12)     {         num = _random.next(0  26);         let = (char)( a  + num);         tempname = tempname + let;     }     stemppath = sdirectory + @ \  + tempname + @ .  + sext;     //messagebox.show(stemppath); } while (!file.exists(stemppath)); </code></pre>   so with my logic  when do loop starts  it directly triggers the while loop inside it. while loop exists after <code>tempname.length</code> is greater than 12 and then do loop should exit since the file doesn t exists. so where am i wrong,c#
python backtracking (queens checkboard)  ok so finally after hours and hours of struggling with my head i finally understood how backtracking works. though i still think there are secrets left to be understood. anyways  i m trying to create the 4-queens problem on the checkboard. practically i m giving myself a blank checkboard (it s 4x4 actually) and i need to find 4 places where those queens won t attack themselves. a queen attacks the row  column and diagonal it belongs too.  here is what i ve done so far (the valid func isn t complete yet  but it doesn t really matter. i just need the backtrack function to work).   <pre><code>def findnextcell(grid i j):      for index in range(i 4):         for jindex in range(j 4):             return index  jindex      for index in range(0 4):         for jindex in range(0 4):             if grid[index][jindex] == 0:                 return index  jindex      return -1 -1   def isvalid(grid  index  jindex  queen):      rowok = all([queen != grid[index][x] for x in range(4)])     if rowok:         columnok = all([queen != grid[x][jindex] for x in range(4)])         if columnok:             return true     return false  def queensolve(grid  i=0  j=0  num_queens = 0):      i  j = findnextcell(grid  i  j)     print grid     if num_queens == 4:         return true     if isvalid(grid  i  j  1):         grid[i][j]=1         num_queens += 1         if (queensolve(grid  i  j  num_queens)):             return true         grid[i][j]=0     return false  input = [[0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0]]  print queensolve(input) </code></pre>,python

ping and bandwidth  we are developing an application that uses asihttp libraries. once the application loaded  we have an interface to choose logging in like a registered user and as visitor.  previously  we catch from our server if there are new things to download or not showing an activity indicator until it s done with the operation  and then we load the contents correctly to show in the interface and show it. one big problem we have is that  in very poor quality and slow connections (with 3g  wifi)  downloading and connecting processes never end  so we have the activity indicator running and running... 5  10  15 ... minutes for only a few kb to get (10kb or less).    we have thought about some possibilities:    1 - the most trivial: set a time out to all asynchornous requests and when any of them reach it  abort all requests and then load the interfaz post-log-in and the app runs normally.     the problem is: we can loose data when ping is a little high in one moment and the bandwidth is effectivly usable. the time we spend in these comprobations is too elevated so we threw this possibility    2 - know ping  bandwidth (connection quality in speed and ping terms)  beforehand when application is launching so when user logs in  we can determine if it is viable or not to download contents and so on    i ve search and i found sample codes that finds the reachability of a server.    any idea how can we do this      thanks.,iphone

rails -double negative of variable  <strong>* warning - newbie alert *</strong>    i m reading a book called railsspace to learn ruby on rails framework. the author built user profiles which the user can edit  and now he s building the public facing profiles based off the other user profiles. the only change he has to make is to basically hide the edit links on the public facing profile. he uses this function to hide it  but i don t understand how it works...hide_edit_links is a variable   <pre><code> # return true if hiding the edit links for spec  faq  etc.       def hide_edit_links       not @hide_edit_links.nil        end </code></pre>   he also writes   <blockquote>    by the way  the reason hide_edit_links  works in general is that   instance variables are nil if not defined  so the function returns   false unless @hide_edit_links is set explicitly.  </blockquote>   but i don t really get it.     can you explain in a bit more detail for a newbie      he implements it later with this   <pre><code>&lt;div class= sidebar_box &gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;% unless hide_edit_links  %&gt; &lt;span class= edit_link &gt; &lt;%= link_to  (edit)   :controller =&gt;  faq   :action =&gt;  edit  %&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; </code></pre>,ruby-on-rails
data flow in social application (ios)  i am building a social network and have bounced to an idea that i do something wrong.     basically i have sort of feeds on different screen to present to a user  like a fb or instagram with one difference - my main content is music. i mean audio tracks  that is supposed to be played by user.     basically what i do is: async fetching a json (with urls to audio files)- parsing - rendering feed via callback. thats all.  i have image chaching so one image would not be downloaded twice.    should i implement a chaching of audio data  i am afraid that would be an overkill because use case of my app is not so intense as instagram s or fb s.,ios

signing ios app: app id cannot be registered to your development team  i need to replace a deployed ios native app with a new ionic3 / cordova hybrid app. the new hybrid app builds successfully (on macos sierra 10.12.6) but i can t sign the app (so that it can be uploaded to the app store).    as a first step  i m focused on getting the new app on the app store (as alpha to test with testflight). i ve removed all  development  certificates/profiles from developer.apple.com.    there s a lot of information/questions/answers on the web about signing apps. i ve spent a couple of days on this issue and cannot get it to work no matter what i read or what i try.    <strong>the current ios app code (deployed)</strong>    in info.plist  $(product_bundle_identifier)    in /bbh.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj  product_bundle_identifier =  nsp.bbh-mobile ;    <strong>re-create development provision</strong>   <ol> <li>open keychain. delete all developer/iphone certificates. delete all keys.</li> <li>on developer.apple.com  delete development certificate and development provisioning profiles.</li> <li>confirm my iphone device is registered with correct udid.</li> <li>in keychain  generate a certificate signing request file.</li> <li>in developer.apple.com  create a development certificate  upload the certificate signing request generated in previous step  download the certificate .cer file.</li> <li>double click on .cer file. keychain opens. choose to add to  login .</li> <li>in keychain > certificates  choose export  specify strong password. certificates.p12 file will be generated.</li> <li> in developer.apple.com  create development provisioning profile. choose  ios app development . choose an app id ... but which one     app ids in developer.apple.com bbh mobile = com.bbh.* bbh mobile = nsp.bbh-mobile xcode ios wildcard app id = *    notice on screen reads:  if you plan to use services such as game center  in-app purchase  and push notifications  or want a bundle id unique to a single app  use an explicit app id. if you want to create one provisioning profile for multiple apps or don t need a specific bundle id  select a wildcard app id. wildcard app ids use an asterisk (*) as the last digit in the bundle id field. please note that ios app ids and mac app ids cannot be used interchangeably.     we need push notifications so choose an explicit app id = ayw4j8p7x3.nsp.bbh-mobile app id = team id (generated by apple) + bundle id (supplied by user) it makes sense to choose this app id which includes the bundle id of the ios currently deployed. <a href= https://www.screencast.com/t/c0qdpdxwh09t  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://www.screencast.com/t/c0qdpdxwh09t</a>    choose development certificate (just created)  choose all devices. </li> <li> download the development profile and double click to install (in xcode). </li> </ol>   double clicking doesn t seem to do anything  how do i know it s installed in xcode correctly  do i need the .mobileprovision file on my iphone  the mac server is in the cloud so i don t have my iphone connected via usb to the mac.   <ol start= 10 > <li>open xcode. confirm my apple account added in xcode > preferences > accounts. in project  targets  signing  click  automatically manage signing .</li> <li> choose my personal team. the following errors are displayed:    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/utjrj.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/utjrj.png  alt= enter image description here ></a>    <strong>error 1:</strong> the app id  nsp.bbh-mobile  cannot be registered to your development team. change your bundle identifier to a unique string to try again.    why does it prompt to change bundle id  isn t it standard to have one app id and to generate both a debug/development and release     <strong>error 2:</strong> no profiles for  nsp.bbh-mobile  were found xcode couldn t find any ios app development provisioning profiles matching  nsp.bbh-mobile . </li> </ol>   but we just created a new development provision and selected app id = nsp.bbh-mobile. why doesn t xcode recognize this,ios

advantages of update  targetsdkversion  in android project  i m trying to understand the reason of update <strong>targetsdkversion</strong> in my project.    let s me explain     when i first created my project i set targetsdkversion to <strong>22</strong>.    now i can update it to 26 if i want  but... <strong>why </strong>    <strong>if i do it  it is necessary to explicitly request for permissions in code</strong> (targetsdkversion 23)    i couldn t find any documentation related with the advantages of update targetsdkversion.    i test my app everyday with mobile phone with android oreo  nougat  etc. i know my app works great with targetsdkversion 22.     but  again  i have to destinate time to fix lots of issues that i will get when i update it (request for permission  may be some ui issues  etc). i need technical reasons to warrant the time i will destinate    of course one of the reason is maintenance  because you are out of date  etc. great. <strong>but i m looking for technical reasons to answer the question</strong>     e.g:  if you update your targetsdk from 22 to 23  you will have an improvement  in how your app uses the battery of your mobile phone .     it will be great if someone can attach official documentation related with the improvement for each targetsdkversion.    <strong>my compilesdkversion and buildtoolsversion are 26.</strong>    thanks and good coding!    <strong>edit:</strong> i know the definition of targetsdkversion  but what i mean: if my app works great  why i need to update it  i don t have to implements new features.,android
launchmodes  singletask: how to switch between  screens   is intents the only way  and if so i think i have a problem  in a number of questions (<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2013865/header-views-and-buttons-how-do-i-attach-listeners-to-buttons-in-a-header-th >like this one</a>) i have been looking into how to  change screens  in my app. i have a  header  on top  with 4 buttons. each button is meant to replace the  content  (ie change screen):   <pre><code>+--------------------+ | menu with buttons  | +--------------------+ |                    | |                    | |  c o n t e n t     | |                    | |                    | +--------------------+ </code></pre>   when i click a menu button  i run the following code:   <pre><code>@override public void onclick(view v) {     intent myintent = new intent(baseactivity.this  activitymain.class);     baseactivity.this.startactivity(myintent); } </code></pre>   as you can see  the <i>startactivity</i> is executed. now  if i do not specify <i> launchmode </i> for the activity that means that launchmode = normal. if launchmode == normal that means that the activity will be re-created each and every time i navigate using the top header buttons  and that means that all data entered in  form elements  are gone (or at least hidden).    so  i found the launchmode  singletask  that sounded sort of nice. if i add that launchmode to my activity  it will not be re-created when i navigate with the buttons  thus keeping state. great! well  until i read <a href= http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals.html#acttask  rel= nofollow noreferrer >this</a>:    <i>as noted above  there s never more than one instance of a  singletask  or  singleinstance  activity  so that instance is expected to handle all new intents.</i>    i found out that the sentence mean that <b>there can be only one</b> activity that has the launchmode set to  singletask  - if i have more than one it wont work (no compiler error though).     <b>this means that i can only  keep the state  for one activity  when switching back and forth (navigating) between my screens!</b>    <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2032173/configuration-changed-orientation-change-and-destroying-activities-is-this-th >once again</a>  is this really how it supposed to work,android

confused about how i should handle my looping thread  i m currently confused on how i should solve a certain problem:    i have a thread  whose <code>run()</code> method approximately looks like this:   <pre><code>@override public void run() {     running = true;      while(running) {         foo(x);         draw(x);     } } </code></pre>   now this foo does something with variable <code>x</code>.    in the main thread theres a listener executing a method  which also changes <code>x</code>   <pre><code>@override public void mousedragged(mouseevent e) {     bar(x); } </code></pre>   the problem is now  that sometimes <code>x</code> gets modified by the <code>bar(x)</code> method  while <code>foo(x)</code> also changes <code>x</code>  which messes <code>x</code> up.    what i think could be done to fix this is for the listener  when firing  to wait for the loop to reach its end  execute its method and <code>bar(x)</code> while letting the thread wait and then notify the thread to let it continue looping after that.    i m not very experienced with thread-handling though and would appreciate it  if someone helped me out. sorry if this problem is really easy to solve and i just can t see the solution.,java

how to pass content of linkedlist between classes of same package  i m developing a console java program for an auctioning system. in the main class (auctioningsystem) i hard-coded a linkedlist of users:   <pre><code>//linked lists declared to store  auctions  users  and items private static linkedlist&lt;user&gt; users = new linkedlist&lt;user&gt;();     public auctioningsystem(){  }  public static void main(string[] args) {      //inserting users in the system  buyers and sellers (hard-coded)     users.add(new user( abel    pw123    seller ));     users.add(new user( kamil    pw123    seller ));     users.add(new user( rob    pw123    seller )); </code></pre>   ...    now  i want to call a method of the class user (from the system class) that i m using to check the username and password (passing linkedlist  username and password as arguments)    the question is how can i do to compare the username and password indroduced by keypad with usernames and passwords in the linkedlist     as when i print the content of the linked list it shows:   <pre><code>    iterator&lt;user&gt; iterator = users.iterator();     while(iterator.hasnext())     {         system.out.println(iterator.next());     }   </code></pre>   content:    user@72ea2f77    user@33c7353a    user@681a9515    this is the method of the class user to validate user login:   <pre><code>public static boolean validatelogin( linkedlist&lt;user&gt; users  string username  string password){  iterator&lt;user&gt; spin = users.iterator();     while (spin.hasnext()){         system.out.println( i m roling );         if(username.equals(users.contains(username)) &amp;&amp; password.equals(users.contains(password))){             system.out.println( bingo! );             return userlogedin=true;         }         else{             return false;         }     } </code></pre>   this is my initial idea but it doesn t work  i think i m not accessing in the right way to the data in the linkedlist or something like that but don t know how to fix it :( any ideas  thanks in advance!,java

select the  common functionality  iterator category  there are quite a few situations when you deal with iterators of different types and want to know which operations are available on all of them. my hope is that you can deduce that from their iterator category.    let s say  for instance  that you re writing a <code>chain_iterator</code>  or a <code>zip_iterator</code> and want to define its <code>iterator_category</code> from its components  <code>iterator_category</code>s. is it a valid approach to say:   <ol> <li> if at least one is an <code>output_iterator</code>  the common category is <code>output_iterator_tag</code>  unless at least one of them is an <code>input_iterator</code>  in which case the common category is undefined; </li> <li> if at least one is an <code>intput_iterator</code>  the common category is <code>input_iterator_tag</code>  unless at least one of them is an <code>output_iterator</code>  in which case the common category is undefined; </li> <li> else the common category is deduced to be the first of <code>forward_iterator_tag</code>  <code>bidirectional_iterator_tag</code>  <code>random_access_iterator_tag</code> to appear in the list of the underlying iterators  types. </li> </ol>   to say it in code:   <pre><code>template &lt;typename... iterators&gt; using least_powerful_iterator =     std::conditional_t&lt;contains&lt;std::input_iterator_tag          category&lt;iterators&gt;...&gt; &amp;&amp;                       !contains&lt;std::output_iterator_tag         category&lt;iterators&gt;...&gt;  std::input_iterator_tag      std::conditional_t&lt;contains&lt;std::input_iterator_tag          category&lt;iterators&gt;...&gt; &amp;&amp;                       contains&lt;std::output_iterator_tag          category&lt;iterators&gt;...&gt;  unknown_iterator_category      std::conditional_t&lt;contains&lt;std::output_iterator_tag         category&lt;iterators&gt;...&gt; &amp;&amp;                       !contains&lt;std::input_iterator_tag          category&lt;iterators&gt;...&gt;  std::output_iterator_tag      std::conditional_t&lt;contains&lt;std::output_iterator_tag         category&lt;iterators&gt;...&gt; &amp;&amp;                       contains&lt;std::input_iterator_tag           category&lt;iterators&gt;...&gt;  unknown_iterator_category          std::conditional_t&lt;contains&lt;std::forward_iterator_tag        category&lt;iterators&gt;...&gt;  std::forward_iterator_tag      std::conditional_t&lt;contains&lt;std::bidirectional_iterator_tag  category&lt;iterators&gt;...&gt;  std::bidirectional_iterator_tag      std::conditional_t&lt;contains&lt;std::random_access_iterator_tag  category&lt;iterators&gt;...&gt;  std::random_access_iterator_tag      unknown_iterator_category&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;; </code></pre>,c++

so i wrote this code but the loop doesn t work  so i was given this problem  where i am to calculate and decide if a number(between 1 and 100) is special or not. if the sum of the digits is multiplied by 4 and the result is equal to the original number  then that number is a special number. so i wrote the code. but the loop is not working. outside of any loop the code works without any issue where variable number may have any value. what might be the issue  thanks in advance.   <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  int main(void) {     int number;     int originalnumber;  for(number=1;number&lt;=100;number++) {                originalnumber = number;      int sum = 0  result;      while(number&gt;0)     {         result = number % 10;         sum = sum + result;         number = number / 10;     }      if((sum*4)==originalnumber)     {         printf( \n%d is special number.   originalnumber);     }     else     {         printf( \n%d is not special number.   originalnumber);     } } } </code></pre>,c

am i correctly understanding what all these pointers are pointing at   i created a program that creates three c-strings  then an array of pointers the size of the amount of c-strings that i created (3)  with each pointer in the array pointing at the first character of each of the three strings  and then finally a pointer to the array of pointers (which would be pointing at the first pointer in the array).     here s the code:   <pre><code>    int main() {     char arr1 [] =  hello ;     char arr2 [] =  dear ;     char arr3 [] =  world ;      char* p1[3];     *p1 = arr1;     *(p1+1) = arr2;     *(p1+2) = arr3;     char** ptr = p1; } </code></pre>   however  when i do something like <code>std::cout &lt;&lt; *ptr &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code> i expect it to just output the address of the first pointer in the array of pointers. however  it actually prints out the whole word <code> hello </code>  which seems weird to me. i would expect an address  and if i outputted <code>**ptr</code>  i would expect for it to just print out the letter <code> h </code> (which it actually does)am i not understanding something correctly  the same thing if i did <code>std::cout &lt;&lt; *(ptr+1)</code>..i would expect the address of the second pointer in the array of pointers <code>p1</code>  but it actually prints out the whole word  dear.  i m so lost..i thought dereferencing <code>ptr</code> would give me the address to <code>p1</code>  which dereferencing it twice would give me the value inside of the address of <code>p1</code>.,c++

python method not affecting instance of class  my question is in the <code>del_node</code> method  despite setting <code>self = self.next</code>  this seems to have no affect on the instance of the class that s making the call.    for instance  if i have a linked list l = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4    calling <code>l.del_node(x)</code>  where <code>x</code> is any node other than the first   simply making the call this way will work  however  if i were to call <code>l.del_node(1)</code> i have to call it as <code>l = l.del_node(1);</code> i m assuming this has to do  with not changing any values of the instance as i am with the others (eg resetting  <code>self.data</code> / <code>next</code>  etc).    i ask because i m confused why the statement <code>self = self.next</code> doesn t seem to affect the instance when <code>self.data = ...</code> does.   <pre><code>class node():      def __init__(self data = none):         self.data = data         self.next = none      def add_node(self data):          if self.data == none:             self.data = data          else:             while self.next != none:                 self = self.next             self.next = node(data)       def del_node(self data):          if self.data == none:             print  error: null list              return self          elif self.data == data:             if self.next == none:                 self.data = none                 return self             else:                 #this seems to be the only case where                 #instance = instance.del_node() matters (why )                 #opposed to just instance.del_node()                 return self.next          start = self         prev = self         self = self.next          while self.next != none:             if self.data == data:                 prev.next = self.next                 return start             prev = self             self = self.next          if self.data == data:             prev.next = none             return start         else:             print  error: value not in list              return start      def get_len(self):         length = 0         if self.data == none:             return length          while self.next != none:             length += 1             self = self.next         return length + 1      def __str__(self):          string =             while self.next != none:             string += str(self.data) +   -&gt;               self = self.next         return string + str(self.data) </code></pre>,python

how to run a function on server-side on a button click event which won t affect postback of page (asp.net)   i have a button-click event on my code-behind which uploads some data from an excel sheet to database. this upload triggers another function which does some maintenance activities over the uploaded data on the database.   <pre><code>protected void btnupload_click(object sender  eventargs e) {     //some excel upload code     recon.start(); //maintanance task. takes atleast 20s to execute. } </code></pre>   now the problem is until this <code>recon.start()</code> function completes  the postback doesn t happen and the page keeps loading on client-side. i want to make the page-load independent of this last function i.e. <code>recon.start()</code>    can you tell me the possible ways     <strong>update :</strong>    after some research  i found that an <code>windows service</code> could do the job more efficiently. i need to isolate and separate the <code>recon.start()</code> code as an windows service and need to call or trigger this from my <code>button_click</code> event.,asp.net

is there a way to identify error cause for a html link element   the <a href= https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/html/element/link  rel= nofollow >html link element</a> supports <code>onerror</code> handler to react to an error loading the linked resource. however  the <code>onerror</code> handler accepts an <code>event</code> object that does not seem to be carrying any information about an actual error cause. for example  loading of the referenced resource could fail due to some internal server error (i.e. http 500) or some security restrictions (i.e. http 403).    is there a way to identify the root cause for a <code>link</code> element failing to load its resource,html

check if a character in a string is a 1 or a 0  i am recieveing a string via a com port that looks like this *000000  or *110101  or anything in between. each character represents the status of a relay on a pcb i have and the first character after the asterisk represents the first relay and so on. i need to check each character seperatly if it is a 1 or a 0 and then set a label to either on or off accordingly.     my code would be something like this:   <pre><code>if(char 1 ==  1 ) {      label4.text =  on ;     } else {     label4.text =  off ; } </code></pre>   and so on down the line for all 6 characters. but i don t know how to seperate each character.    thanks!,c#

listview divider not applied when specified in style declaration  this is more  why   than  how   question  since i know a simple workaround for the problem. but i d like to know what logic is behind behavior i m going to describe.    i ve got a style declaraion and some listviews. i want to change the way divider looks. i used following declaration:   <pre><code>&lt;style name= theme.myapp.dark  parent= @style/theme.sherlock &gt;     &lt;item name= android:dividerheight &gt;4px&lt;/item&gt;     &lt;item name= android:divider &gt;#123456&lt;/item&gt; &lt;/style&gt; </code></pre>   to my amusement  only the height of the divider was applied. i ve tried specifying color with alpha value (#12345678) and gradient drawable  nothing works. listviews are declared like this:   <pre><code>&lt;listview xmlns:android= http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android      android:id= @+id/list        android:layout_width= fill_parent       android:layout_height= fill_parent /&gt;  </code></pre>   so  as you can see there s nothing that could override style declaration. i can change the divider only when i specify it directly in listview declaration:   <pre><code>&lt;listview xmlns:android= http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android      android:id= @+id/list        android:divider= #123456      android:layout_width= fill_parent       android:layout_height= fill_parent /&gt;  </code></pre>   using my newly-acquired skill of <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8630694/ >specifying colors depending on theme selected</a>  i can work around this very easily - i will just have to declare <code>android:divider</code> with custom color attribute for every list.    but why i can t change <code>android:divider</code> in the style  just like the <code>android:dividerheight</code>  is there some reason for that  i couldn t find an explanation  bug report or something similar that would let me understand this behavior.    edit: the theme is applied globally  in the manifest file:   <pre><code>&lt;application android:icon= @drawable/icon  android:label= @string/app_name  android:name= org.my.app  android:theme= @style/theme.myapp.dark &gt; </code></pre>,android
is there a way to say the object only once when i have to use it again and again   take for example:   <pre><code>int main(void){     numbercomparator comparator1;      comparator1.seta(78.321);     comparator1.showa();     comparator1.setb( c );     comparator1.setb( yes );     comparator1.setb(124.213);     comparator1.showb();     comparator1.setb(12);      return 0; } </code></pre>   instead of saying <code>comparator1</code> over and over again  can i do something shorter     i understand that this doesn t really change much about how the program works  but it does make it easier to work around with testing a class i make.     i am doing overloading so that for an assortment of inputs into my comparator  my program can handle them without making the results go crazy. in this case  i want the input to be an <code>int</code>  but what if the input isn t     the answer could be lying around the internet  but as my title may infer  i do not know how to state the question.,c++
how can i get the number of bytes allocated by mmap   i m building a custom implementation of <code>malloc</code> using mmap.    if the user wants to allocate 500 bytes of memory  i call <code>mmap(0  500  prot_read | prot_write  map_shared | map_anonymous  -1  0)</code>. <code>mmap</code> returns a pointer to a block with size 4096 (if that is the page size).    in my linked list i want to have one block set to 500 bytes marked as taken  and one block set to 4096-500=3596 bytes marked as free. it is not clear  however how much memory <code>mmap</code> really allocates. how can i get that information,c

erase using brush in glpaint  as part of modifying the <code>glpaint</code>  i am trying to add erase functionality where user could select an eraser button and erase the painted area just as painting.     i am trying have a conditional statement within <code> renderlinefrompoint:(cgpoint)start topoint:(cgpoint)end </code> method so that i could check whether the stroke is for painting or erasing.     for erasing i do not know how to make use of the  <code>start</code>  and  <code>end</code>  parameters for erasing. is there any method call in opengl like <code>glclear()</code> that accepts these two parameter and does erase     any pointer will be very helpful. thank you.,iphone
with so many application variations  how to choose which one to specialise in  i was sat infront of stackoverflow last night and i was dumbfounded with the number of individual tags.  it got me thinking about how many different flavours of applications there are out there.  personally  i m a c# man but even i m finding that with wcf  wpf  asp .net 4  silverlight and mvc  there is getting so much choice and am beginning to get bogged down with which one to learn.  i understand that they each have their own purposes  but i m finding that this decision is harder than when asp .net first came out and it was the ideal tool to use over plain html.    i d be interested in hearing others views  whether i m the only one out there who finds that the microsoft suite is increasing quicker than i can keep up with  or just your general views/opinions.,.net

how can i get a path from caller  this is just example to explain.   <pre><code>[./includes/functions.inc.php] function getphpresult($path) {     ob_start();     include $path;     $result = ob_get_clean();      return $result; }  [./pages/a.php] echo getphpresult( b.php );  [./pages/b.php] some php code. </code></pre>   this code doesn t work.<br> because <code> b.php </code> in a.php is not valid path in <code> getphpresult </code>.    if i use <code>include  b.php </code> in a.php  b.php in same directory with a.php will be load.<br> but  if i use <code>getphpresult ( b.php )</code> in a.php  b.php in same directory with functions.inc.php will be load.<br> but i want to load b.php in same directory with a.php    so  i should change <code>getphpresult( b.php )</code> to <code>getphpresult( ../includes/b.php )</code>.<br> but  it will doesn t work if <code>a.php</code> and <code>b.php</code> are moved to other directory.    then  i want to find a correct path in <code>getphpresult</code> function.<br> my solution is just use <code>debug_backtrace</code>.     <pre><code>function getphpresult($path) {     $backtrace = debug_backtrace(debug_backtrace_provide_object  2);     $dir = dirname($backtrace[1][ file ]);      ob_start();     include $dir .  /  . $path;     return ob_get_clean(); } </code></pre>   but  i think it isn t good way.<br> how can i find a correct path without <code>debug_backtrace</code>,php

round numbers to hundredths place in objective c  i have multiple numbers of minutes and hours. what i want to do  is add all them up together. for example: if i have the numbers: 31  15 and 45. those are for minutes. i then have 2  3 and 1 which are for hours. i want to add all the numbers and get the hours and minutes.    i so far added all the minutes together (31 + 15 + 45 = 91)  then i multiplied all the hours by 60 (2 * 60 = 120; 3 * 60 = 180; 1 * 60 = 60) so they get converted to minutes.     i then add the final numbers together (91 + 120 + 180 + 60 = 451).    the final step would be to divide 451 / 60 = 7.5166666...7.    my question is  being that what i did so far was correct  how do i get the final number to be rounded out to the hundredths place  so that 7.51666... will become 7.52     i will be displaying the final number (7.52) in a <code>uilabel</code>.    <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/752817/rounding-numbers-in-objective-c >this</a> question doesn t answer my question because that question is asking how to round off numbers to the nearest .5. my question  is how to round off a number.,objective-c

custom tabbar: adjusting the view of the displayed view controller so it is resized to fit above the tabbar  i need to create a customtabbar in one of my app. i subclassed uitabbarcontroller by adding a custom view to it. i made the tabbar hidden by setting   <pre><code>self.tabbar.hidden = true; </code></pre>   i added buttons on the customview  and on click of these buttons am handling the switching between the tabs.    the issue that am facing is that the height of my custom tabbar is not equal to (more than) the standard tabbar height  so i need to clip my viewcontroller s view so that it doesn t hide behind the custom tabbar    i tried setting the frame property of viewcontroller s view (see below) in viewdidload and viewdidappear methods  but it doesn t work that way.   <pre><code>[self.view setframe: cgrectmake(self.view.frame.origin.x  self.view.frame.origin.x  self.view.frame.size.width  400)]  </code></pre>   where 400 = 480 - height of my custom tabbar    i hope am clear with my question..    thanks in advance,iphone

sending function pointer with arguments with it and then add additional arguments while invoking  i have a map which says maps a string to a function like :   <pre><code>validator = { first_name  : validate_str                last_name  : validate_str                phone  : validate_phone } </code></pre>   i need to call the corresponding validate function based on the type of value i have in the map that will be fed to me as input for e.g.   <pre><code>for name in elements:     # validate the value of this name in the input map using the function     # input is the map that has the value for each of these fields     # elements is a list of all fields used to loop through one input at a time     if validator[name]( input[name] ) is false:         # throw validation error     else:         # do something else </code></pre>   this works fine unless for this scenario i am not sure if it can be done:    the validate_str also checks if a given string is of desired max length.   <pre><code>def validate_str(str  max-len):     # throw error if len(str) &gt; max-len </code></pre>   the max-len can differ based on the string  so i need to call validate_str for first_name with say 64 characters and last name with 256 characters.     i can use a different map to say that this field has this max_len  but is it possible for the validator map to have pointer to the validate_str function with the max-len argument preset based on the field     something like:   <pre><code>validator = { first_name  : validate_str(max-len=64)                last_name  : validate_str(max-len=256)                phone  : validate_phone } </code></pre>   then call it for validation like:   <pre><code>if validator[name]( str=input[name] ) is false:     # the appropriate value for max-len goes with the function call and just the     # str is appended to the argument list while invoking.  </code></pre>   this makes life easier so that we need not then remember again what fields will have the max-len sent along with it.,python
add thread into thread array  take a look at my code.   <pre><code>thread[] connect_thread; public void thread_runned() {     connect_thread = new thread[datagridview1.selectedrows.count];     for (int index = 0; index &lt; datagridview1.selectedrows.count; index++)     {         connect_thread[index] = new thread(new threadstart(connect));         connect_thread[index].start();     } } public void connect() {    //performance code here } public void buttonclick1() {     //user select rows 0-4     thread_runned(); }  public void buttonclick2() {     //user select rows 5-9     thread_runned(); } </code></pre>   according to the code above  when i run it  and click on <code>buttonclick1</code> and <code>buttonclick2</code>  it returns two different <code>connect_thread</code>s (see this debug for more detail.)   <pre><code>//debug when buttonclick1 is running connect_thread = array(     [0] = system.threading.thread     [1] = system.threading.thread     [2] = system.threading.thread     [3] = system.threading.thread )  //debug when buttonclick2 is running connect_thread = error: index was outside the bounds of the array. </code></pre>   now  i want to add a new thread item into this thread array  but the indeces must continue like the old thread items (i.e  the next indeces will be <code>[4]</code>  <code>[5]</code>  <code>[6]</code>  etc.)    i m not worrying about this error:   <pre><code>//debug when buttonclick2 is running connect_thread = error: index was outside the bounds of the array. </code></pre>   because i can create a list of threads using <code>datagridview1.rows.count</code>  and it will work fine. however  i m looking to do it the other way other because when the user adds more data into <code>datagridview</code>  the index will be wrong again.    how can i append new threads to the end of my thread array while preserving indeces,c#

how to enable client side validation in bootstrap modal  i work on app which have bootstrap modal(for sign in/registration) where <strong>client side validation</strong> is performed. when you try to sign in with regular  but non existing email in db  <strong>server side validation</strong> is performed and you are redirected to users/signin page.     so  instead of that redirection  i need to make validations on client side and show error message in modal. problem is  i work on real  big app for first time and i cant find place where those validations and redirections are performed. i can t find any relevant js file or controller actions..    user model:   <pre><code>  validates :password  presence: true  :on =&gt; :create   validates :password  confirmation: true  :on =&gt; :create   validates :email  presence: true   validates :username  uniqueness: true  presence: true   validates_format_of :username  :with  =&gt; /^[a-z\d]*$/  :message =&gt;  just letters and numbers please  </code></pre>   modal for registration:   <pre><code>#modal-registration.modal.hide.fade{ aria-hidden  =&gt;  true    aria-labelledby  =&gt;  registrationlabel   role:  dialog   tabindex:  -1 }   .modal-header     %button.close{ aria-hidden  =&gt;  true    data-dismiss  =&gt;  modal   type:  button } ×     %h3#mymodallabel registration   .modal-body     .row-fluid       .span6         = simple_form_for(resource  :as =&gt; resource_name  :url =&gt; registration_path(resource_name)  html: { class:  form   id:  registration-form  }  :validate =&gt; true) do |f|           .control-group             .controls               = f.input :email  autofocus: true  label: false  placeholder:  email            .control-group             .controls               = f.input :username  autofocus: true  label: false  placeholder:  username            .control-group             .controls               = f.input :password  label: false  placeholder:  password            .control-group             .controls               = f.input :password_confirmation  label: false  placeholder:  password confirmation            .control-group             .controls               = f.button :submit   registration        .span6         = link_to  registration via facebook    #   class:  btn btn-large btn-block          = link_to  registration via linkedin    #   class:  btn btn-large btn-block    .modal-footer     %button.btn{ aria-hidden  =&gt;  true    data-dismiss  =&gt;  modal } close </code></pre>   client_side_validation jquery:   <pre><code>jquery -&gt;   $( #modal-registration  #modal-sign-in ).on  shown   -&gt;     $(clientsidevalidations.selectors.forms).validate() </code></pre>   used gems: devise  client_side_validations  client_side_validations_simple_form  bootstrap  haml.,ruby-on-rails
floating point exception for seemingly no reason  my code is throwing me a floating point exception here  but i can t figure out why.   <pre><code>int i = this -&gt; numerator; while(i &gt; 1){     if ((this -&gt; numerator % i == 0) &amp;&amp; (this -&gt; denominator % i == 0)) {         this -&gt; numerator = this -&gt; numerator / i;         this -&gt; denominator = this -&gt; denominator / i;     }     i = i - 1; } </code></pre>   the goal is to simplify a fraction. as you can see  things only get mod by i and i > 1. same goes for division. strangely it will keep throwing the error even if i comment out the code within the while loop  but the code works fine if i get rid of the while loop completely. the same thing happened when i tried to use a for loop instead. what am i missing,c++
positioning elements relative to some ancestor but not necessarily the direct parent   i needed the items in an array of elements to contain 2 things: one element that would be in the regular flow of things and another that was absolute relative to the array container. fiddling around with position: relative/absolute/fixed  i stumbled on this:    html:   <pre><code>&lt;div class= maincontainer &gt;      &lt;div class= flexitem &gt;         stuff1         &lt;div class= itemcontent  style= color:blue &gt;             i m positioned absolutely  relative to the main container         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class= flexitem &gt;         stuff2         &lt;div class= itemcontent  style= color:red &gt;             i m positioned absolutely  relative to the main container too!         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   css:   <pre><code>.maincontainer {     width:60%;     margin-left:20%;     position:relative;     border:1px solid black;     display:flex;     justify-content:space-around; }  .flexitem {     position:static; }  .itemcontent {     position:absolute;     left:0px;     top:20px; } </code></pre>   <a href= https://jsfiddle.net/ruzexo2r/  rel= nofollow >https://jsfiddle.net/ruzexo2r/</a>    its as if an element with position:absolute has any parent with position:relative with nothing in between but position:fixed then they behave just like the absolute/relative elements were immediately related. i didn t find an explicit confirmation about this behavior though so i m asking whether or not i can count on that to keep on working,css

check bounds of a list of images (or the one currently being used in the list)  i have a cat and mouse game and i have the mouse randomly moving about with timers and direction change etc. when the mouse moves left  the picture box changes to another completely separate file so it looks like it has turned.     i m now trying to check if the cat has collided with the mouse so that i can end the game.    does anyone know how i could check the current bounds of the mouse so i can detect when its been hit  i can provide any code needed but as it is long i ll copy and paste on request.    that the question linked below was how i was planning on doing it     <pre><code>public void collsions()          {            if (cat.bounds.intersectswith(mouse.bounds))          } </code></pre>   but i then realized that the mousebounds cant fine a bound as the image changes all the time depending on its direction   <pre><code>mouseimage.image = mouseimages.images[(int)currentdirection]; </code></pre>   so there is a list of images that change depending on the direction of the mouse and i don t know how to check the bounds after the image is changed.     this is all the mouse code: <a href= https://pastebin.com/aeuwbdru  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://pastebin.com/aeuwbdru</a>    this is all the cat code (so far); <a href= https://pastebin.com/ndabdv5c  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://pastebin.com/ndabdv5c</a>,c#

html images - two adjacent images  i have two images that i want adjacent but they appear one above the other. here is the code:   <pre><code>&lt;div style= float:left; &gt; &lt;div style= float:left; &gt; &lt;img src= /logo.png  style= float:left;  /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style= float:left; &gt; &lt;img src= /logo2.png  width= 55  style= float:left;  height= 50 /&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   note that both divs containing the two images are themselves within a div that is floated to the left.    thanks.,html
how to cast a generic parameter   here s what i am trying to write:   <pre><code>public void foo&lt;t&gt;(t parameter) {   otherobject.bar&lt;t&gt;(parameter); } </code></pre>   the signature of the bar() method is:   <pre><code>public void bar&lt;t&gt;(t parameter) where t: class  </code></pre>   so i get a compile error because the t in foo s signature doesn t have the same constraint. unfortunately i can t write:   <pre><code>public void foo&lt;t&gt;(t parameter) where t: class {   otherobject.bar&lt;t&gt;(parameter); } </code></pre>   because foo is implementing a method defined in an external interface.  question is:    can i somehow transpose the t within the method foo before calling bar.  (note  i can be sure that t always will be a class  -  i just need to get past the compiler).    the only way i have found is using reflection but i wonder if there is a simpler trick i m missing.,c#
maximum runtime memory available in iphone and ipod   i am developing an applciation whose run time memory goes upto 6-7mb. when i run the application it works fine but sometimes it breaks on device or shows white screen instead of actual views. when i did some testing i came to know that it was triggering the didrecievememorywarning event.     is it becoz of images  like i am using a lot of animation for which everytime i call the image animation function to get the array of the images. since i am using imagewithname  i need to call everytime. also i am not supposed to release the memory used for the images as i dont own it. i think that this is not the right way to deal with it. is there any good way to deal with this. do anyone have better idea or this is not the problem.     please note that the code dont break on simulator wheras there is no breaking inbetween the code.,iphone

cplusplus.com says that the past-the-end of an std::string  shall not be dereferenced   i would like it if you could clear up some confusion for me. i was writing a function that removes duplicate characters in a string  e.g.  ab -->  aaabb .    <pre><code>void remove_dups(std::string&amp; str) {      std::string::iterator it = str.begin();     while (it != str.end()) {         if (*(it+1) == *it) {             str.erase(it+1);         } else {             ++it;         }     } }  </code></pre>   it seems to work when i test it. however  i was wondering  shouldn t there be a fencepost issue  when  it  is the end of the string  the if statement looks at the non-existent next character. according to cplusplus.com      <em><strong>the past-the-end character is a theoretical character that would follow the last character in the string. it shall not be dereferenced.</em></strong> (<a href= http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/end/  rel= nofollow >http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/end/</a>)    so i m wondering why my function seems to pass the tests and how i can rewrite the whole thing in an elegant way to get around the fencepost issue. (go easy on me  guys. i m a n00b.)    rewriting it like    <pre><code>void remove_dups(std::string&amp; str) {      std::string::iterator it = str.begin();     while (it != str.end()) {         if ((it+1) != str.end() &amp;&amp; *(it+1) == *it) {             str.erase(it+1);         } else {             ++it;         }     } }  </code></pre>   seems inelegant.,c++
add dynamic dotnet webcontrol into attribute value of static html  easy one to explain. is there any way i can do this:   <pre><code>&lt;div id= header  style= &lt;asp:literal runat= server  id= litbackgroundimage &gt;&lt;/asp:literal&gt;  &gt; </code></pre>   it looks valid  but visual studio will not recognise litbackgroundimage as a valid control in the code-behind. setting the div as runat= server  won t work either because the style property is read-only.    any suggestions gratefully received,.net

pushing into arrays in javascript  my script (is meant to) grab text from the a page (which works fine) and then splits it by by newline (\n) and puts each splitted string into an array called  dnasequence ; from there it loops through each element in the array and if the string contains the character  >  it assigns that string to the  var header_name   else it pushes all other lines into a new array called  dnasubseq . the original text looks something like this:   <pre><code>&gt;header_1 gctagctagc cgcgagcgagc &gt;header_2 gcgcatgcgac </code></pre>   when i execute the code it fails to alert on anything. here is the code:   <pre><code>function loadermy() {  var dnasubseq = []; var dnasequence = []; var header_name =   ; var splittedlines = document.getelementbyid( page-wrapper ).innertext; dnasequence = splittedlines.split( \n );  for (var i = 0; i &lt; dnasequence.length; i++) {     if (dnasequence[i].match(/&gt;/)) {         header_name = dnasequence[i];         alert(header_name);     }     else {         dnasubseq.pushvalues(dnasequence[i]);     }     alert(dnasubseq); } } </code></pre>,javascript

trigger for updated date column vs explicitly setting it  i m wondering if using a trigger to set the updated date column of a table (or all tables) is considered a better practice versus having the application explicitly set it. i realize this could devolve into a debate over preferences and design patterns  so in an effort to parameterize the question a bit - i d like to get a take from a best practices stand point. taking separation of concerns into consideration (keeping business logic out of the database type of thing) as well as making sure database columns have what is intended within them (actually updating the  last modified date  column)  i m more inclined to let the database handle this via a trigger. that said  i also tend to shy away from triggers since they tend to hide the consequences of an action in a database. i m hoping that the many smarter people here on so have a more concrete thought than mine.,sql
angularjs: delete clicked elements parent row  i have a table of users  each row representing a user. on the end of each row i have a delete link  which when clicked deletes the user from database.    now i need to update the table to reflect the changes. i know how i would do this with jquery  but how do i do it the angular way  do i need to add a <code>ng-model</code> attribute to each row     this is how i have attached the click event:   <pre><code>&lt;a ng-click= deleteuser(user._id) &gt;delete&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>   i have a <code>&lt;tr ng-repeat= user in users &gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</code> printing out the users. i m thinking if i remove the user from the model  that might be the way to go.    edit: i found now <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14250642/angularjs-how-to-remove-an-item-from-scope >this</a> question  which also answer my question.,angularjs

let variables in classes with  this  context  so i have a question about <code>this</code> and just having normal variables in classes.    normally we do something like this:   <pre><code>class thingy {   constructor(thing) {     this.id = thing   }   printid() {     console.log(this.id)   } } let newthingy = new thingy( id1 ) let newthingy2 = new thingy( id2 ) newthingy.printid() newthingy2.printid() </code></pre>   which works just fine  however something like this will not:   <pre><code>class thingy {   constructor(thing) {     let id = thing   }   printid() {     console.log(id)   } } let newthingy = new thingy( id1 ) let newthingy2 = new thingy( id2 ) newthingy.printid() newthingy2.printid() </code></pre>   so i understand that <code>newthingy</code> will have no idea what <code>id</code> is  so won t it just look up the prototype chain back at the original class prototype  i realize it probably wouldn t get the right <code>id</code> but how come we get a <code>id not defined error</code>  should it attempt to look up the prototype chain first,javascript

how to use ng-show  ng-change  & ng-class to style validation hints/errors  i would like to present my user with 2 types of validation:   <ol> <li>while they are typing in an input field  i d like a hint to show up next to the input with a friendly  grey/black hint box if the current value is invalid</li> <li>then  when they blur out of the input  if the entered value is still invalid  i d like to change the style of the hint to a more traditional red prompt. when they come back to the input to fix it  i d like to return to the friendly hints in #1.</li> </ol>   i d like to reuse the hint boxes to cut down on clutter (meaning i don t want a <code>div</code> for the friendly version of a hint  and a <code>div</code> for the traditional version of the exact same validation failure)  and i d like to use angular s validation markup (<code>ng-maxlength</code>  <code>ng-pattern</code>  etc) to allow me to respond to the user s input in helpful ways  like saying  numbers only  if they are entering text in an  age  input  or  that value is too high  if they try to put  1000  as the age.    i have a working example (sortof)  but i feel there may perhaps be a better way to do this  (perhaps using directives ) but if nothing else  i don t see why my current solution is failing. i think i m just missing something in the jquery selector  but any help would be great.     specifically  when the user is typing in the input  the friendly hint doesn t have the correct style.  easy jquery fix  any thoughts on a more concise solution  thanks in advance.    <a href= http://plnkr.co/edit/s4jzmcln3qfxga8fmmsb p=preview  rel= nofollow >plunkr</a>    html:   <pre><code>    &lt;body ng-controller= myctrl &gt;     &lt;label class= control-label &gt;number of dependents:&lt;/label&gt;     &lt;form name= demographicsform &gt;       &lt;div ng-class= {true:  control-group error   false:  control-group }[demographicsform.dependents.$invalid] &gt;         &lt;input type= text                  class= mini-input control                  id= dependents                  name= dependents                  ng-model= demographicsholder.dependents                  ng-pattern= /^([1-9][0-9] |)$/                  ng-change= change( dependentsvalidation )                  maxlength= 2                  required /&gt;          &lt;!-- this error should fire when the input is the wrong type (text/number/etc) or format--&gt;         &lt;div class= validation-err help-inline error                name= dependentsvalidationpattern                ng-show= demographicsform.dependents.$error.pattern &gt;           a 2 digit number is required         &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;!-- this error should fire when the input is empty --&gt;         &lt;div class= validation-err help-inline error                name= dependentsvalidationrequired                ng-show= demographicsform.dependents.$error.required &gt;             required field         &lt;/div&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/form&gt;             &lt;/body&gt; </code></pre>   controller:   <pre><code>var app = angular.module( myapp   []); app.controller( myctrl   function($scope) {    $scope.demographicsholder = {name: bob  dependents:1};    $scope.change = function(validationdivs) {     $( validationdivs ).removeclass(  .validation-err  );     $( validationdivs ).addclass(  .validation-hint  );      $(  #  + elemid ).blur(function() {       $(  #  + elemid ).removeclass(  .validation-hint  );       $(  #  + elemid ).addclass(  .validation-err  );     });   }; }); </code></pre>   css:   <pre><code>  .validation-hint {       background-color: #0e0e0e;   }    .validation-err {     background-color: #ffe5e5;   } </code></pre>   the validation works as i want  but i want the hint to show up and be styled as desired while the user is actually typing in the box.,angularjs

custom logic for back button press in uinavigationcontroller  a more detailed explanation of my app layout: clicking on any of the rows of the table view will take the user to the next screen with a back button pointing back to home and a segmented control on the top. a logic in the code determines which of the segments of the segmented control will be preselected. the user can click on any of the indexes of the segmented control to change the content displayed on the screen.     the way i have implemented the above layout is through a navigation controller. the content of each of the pages corresponding to “first  second &amp; third  of the segmented control are all separate view controllers. the reason i have it this way is because each of these pages have significant functionality and controls for the user to interact with. keeping them each as a separate view controller helps software code organization and data integrity. the home screen is at index zero of the stack of navigation controllers   view controller corresponding to first at index one of the navigation controller and so on. let s say the user is currently on the second screen with “first”selected in the segmented control. if the user now clicks on  third   two view controllers are pushed onto the stack and vice versa for popping controllers out of the navigation stack.    two questions:     •   any comments on the way i have implemented  are there suggestions for any better implementations  one specific implementation that i did consider is the possibility of having one view controller with three separate views (one each for first  second &amp; third)  any comments on this approach    <pre><code>•   i seem to have an extremely hard time controlling the behavior of the “back button”of the navigation controller. when the user has selected “second”in the segmented control  i would still like to have the back button saying “home” instead of “first” which is the default behavior of the navigation controller. i have figured out how i can customize the text of the back button. however  i can t seem to figure out how to customize the behavior of the button. what i mean by that is  when the user is on  third”  and clicks on the “home button”i d like to pop three view controllers and land the user on the home screen. </code></pre>   on so  i saw and tried various techniques with no success: approach 1: viewwilldisappear(): determine if this function is being called as part of a back button press and implement the logic of popping additional view controllers beyond the standard one view controller pop. for a moment  this logic does indeed pop back to the home page however it immediately crashes with the following message which i don t seem to understand:    approach 2: didpopitem(): i put the following code in this function    <pre><code>- (void)navigationbar:(uinavigationbar *)navigationbar didpopitem:(uinavigationitem *)item {     nslog(@ %s  __function__);       [[self navigationcontroller] popviewcontrolleranimated:yes];     //viewcontrolleranimated:yes];    nslog(@ navcount%d  self.navigationcontroller.viewcontrollers.count);    if (self.navigationcontroller.viewcontrollers.count &gt; 1) {          [self.navigationcontroller poptoviewcontroller:[self.navigationcontroller.viewcontrollers objectatindex:1] animated:yes];    }  } </code></pre>   any comments on the above will be much appreciated! thanks in advance for your help.,ios

merge tables and keeping all distinct id values  i have multiple tables to merge and these tables may have different id values.    for example:    table 1:   <pre><code>id year month size1 a  2015   4    10 b  2015   5    20 </code></pre>   table 2:   <pre><code>id year month size2 a  2015   4    20 c  2015   5    40 </code></pre>   table 3:   <pre><code>id year month size3 d  2015   6    50 e  2015   7    50 </code></pre>   i want the merged table to look like this:   <pre><code>id year month size1 size2 size3 a  2015   4     10    20   null b  2015   5     20   null  null c  2015   5    null   40   null d  2015   6    null  null  50 e  2015   7    null  null  50 </code></pre>   i want the output id column to include all distinct ids from all the tables. my guess is that this can be somehow achieved by using full outer join on id  but i wasn t quite able to produce the desired output format.,mysql

ios ble how to get 11 25 ms connection interval   i want to get a 11 25 connection interval on ios. but how can i check what connection interval was selected  i have a device with an accelerometer and gyroscope. i sent a request to a device from ios to set connection between 11 25 and 31 25. i need to receive updates every 11 25 ms for my code. can i somehow make the ios device pick the lowest     i need to connect to 2 devices and capture accelerometer and gyroscope data from both devices with interval of 11 25 ms. this is done on android. when i am trying to do the same things on ios i receive accelerometer data from one device almost in 10 ms intervals but others intervals are around 100 ms or even more. how can i improve this,ios
why have duplicated properties for image size   when checking out the specification for the <a href= https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.image(v=vs.110).aspx  rel= nofollow  title= image class ><code>image</code> class</a>  i noticed there are three ways to access the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of the object:   <ol> <li>use <code>height</code>/<code>width</code> property  which returns <code>int32</code></li> <li>use <code>size</code> property  which returns <code>size</code> that has <code>height</code>/<code>width</code> as <code>int32</code></li> <li>use <code>physicaldimension</code> property  which returns <code>sizef</code>  that has <code>height</code>/<code>width</code> as <code>float</code></li> </ol>   what is the reason behind this   are they guaranteed to be always the same   is one preferred over the other      the third one seems to make some sense since it could be either the size in pixels  if the object is a bitmap or the size in millimiter units if it is a metafile.,.net

iphone - overlay transparent image on movieplayer  i ve been able to successfully overlay an image on top of the movieplayer (see the movieplayer example from apple).    however  i would like the effect of having no controls on the screen  and when the screen is touched  my overlay appears.    my thought was to create an overlay with an image that is a transparent png file  and cover the entire display. when this transparent image is touched  the overlay control will appear.    all is working  with the exception of showing a transparent image over the movieplayer. even with a transparent png  the image shows as all black. if i change the alpha for the uiview (overlay) the touch events are not recognized.    i m obviously new to working directly with drawrect() so any insight would be appreciated.,iphone

ios initial view controller based on condition retrieved from database  an ios app i m creating shows a setup screen upon first launch which requires data to be written to the database.    upon launch  i need to access this value form the database.    if it is set  launch main view controller    else show setup view controller.    as far as i m aware theres two ways i can do this  programmatically setting it from the <code>appdelegate</code> or using an initial view controller as a splash screen and performing the look up and segue there.    what would be the best way to approach this  is it wrong to do a database lookup in <code>didfinishlaunchingwithoptions</code>,ios

a char copying function  i am trying to write a function that will allow me to use a function i wrote called strlength to count a number of characters passed  then will mallocate the number in addition to a null terminator  then copy the characters and return the copy.    so far i have:   <pre><code>int strlength(char* tocount) {     int count = 0;      while(*tocount !=  \0 )     {         count++;         tocount++;     }      return count; }  char* strcopy(char *s) {     int length = strlength(s);      char *copy = malloc(length+1);      while(s !=  \0 )     {          s++;     }      return copy; } </code></pre>   strcopy is the function i need help with. i also can not use strcpy or memcpy  i m just writing this on my own to create my own string library. i think before the <code>s++</code> i should have something along the lines of <code>copy += s</code> but i am not sure that would work.    i am a bit of a newbie  so please bear with me,c
how to copy a specific field from a list of any classes in java   let s me start describe my problem.    i have a class  person  which is stored in mpeople list.  so it does mean that the mpeople will store both  name  and  age . but in a certain circumstance  i need a list of all people s name and a list of all people s age in different list.     so is there a way to copy all the data in a specific field of a class in a list to another list or somewhere else     <em>note: i know i can use for loop or enhance for loop to do this but it does not look so good through this. so just curious if someone found any better solutions... and i would appreciate your help!</em>   <pre><code>public class person {   // fields     private int age;     private string name;       // constructor     public person( int age  string name )     {         this.age = age;         this.name = name;     }       // getter     public int getage()     {         return age;     }      public string getname()     {         return name;     } }   //list of people list&lt;person&gt; mpeople = new arraylist&lt;&gt;(); mpeople.add( new person( 10   sovanara  ) ); mpeople.add( new person( 20   dara  ) ); </code></pre>,java
html table is bigger than the browser s window  i have something like this:   <pre><code>&lt;table&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;     &lt;td&gt;&lt;nobr&gt;hello&lt;/nobr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;this column can contain a lot of text  for some rows&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;&lt;nobr&gt;world&lt;/nobr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;&lt;nobr&gt;hello world&lt;/nobr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   ... more rows to come &lt;/table&gt; </code></pre>   basically 3 of the columns have very short text  and i want them to be <code>&lt;nobr&gt;</code>. the other one can have very long text  and i want it to take all the remaining space. but what happens is that the table gets bigger than the whole browser window to accommodate the big column. if the text is <em>really</em> big it will eventually break  but it still gets quite a bit outside the window.    i tried setting width  max-width  but no luck. what am i doing wrong,html
access assests from another application   i get a lot of requests in my application to allow for custom icons packs from bettercut / open home.  the way it seems to work is you install bettercut or open home  then you can install tons of these free icon packs from the market.  once installed both those apps (and other apps) will poll for those icon packs and use the icons.     i want to know how to poll the install applications for the asset folders that are available.  i have opened up a few of the icon packs and verified that there is an assets folder in there and they are full of all the icon png files.    i ve searched on here  other code sites  google  etc but havn t found any leads.    update:    from the answer below i have written some code to try and list a file from my own projects assets directory but it does not seem to work.   <pre><code>resources r = this.getresources(); assetmanager a = r.getassets(); string[] list = a.list( / ); log.d( test    length of / is  +list.length); for (string s : list) {     log.d( test   s); }  log.d( test    length of /assets is  +a.list( /assets ).length); log.d( test    length of /assets/ is  +a.list( /assets/ ).length); log.d( test    length of /assets/ is  +a.list( /assets/ ).length); log.d( test    length of ./assets/ is  +a.list( ./assets/ ).length); log.d( test    length of ./assets is  +a.list( ./assets ).length); </code></pre>   this is the output:   <pre><code>03-16 12:25:04.591: debug/test(13526): length of / is 6 03-16 12:25:04.591: debug/test(13526): androidmanifest.xml 03-16 12:25:04.591: debug/test(13526): meta-inf 03-16 12:25:04.591: debug/test(13526): assets 03-16 12:25:04.591: debug/test(13526): classes.dex 03-16 12:25:04.591: debug/test(13526): res 03-16 12:25:04.591: debug/test(13526): resources.arsc 03-16 12:25:04.614: debug/test(13526): length of /assets is 0 03-16 12:25:04.637: debug/test(13526): length of /assets/ is 0 03-16 12:25:04.661: debug/test(13526): length of /assets/ is 0 03-16 12:25:04.692: debug/test(13526): length of ./assets/ is 0 03-16 12:25:04.716: debug/test(13526): length of ./assets is 0 </code></pre>   update 2 99% there!!!:    i figured out that you can read from the assets directory without actually using the folder name:   <pre><code>inputstream is = assetmanager.open( test.png ); </code></pre>   i also tried this with an asset in appliction 2 from application 1  where the folder path is /asset/icon/image.png:   <pre><code>inputstream is = assetmanager.open( icon/image.png ); </code></pre>   next i figured out that you can list a directory inside assets:   <pre><code>string[] list = assetmanager.list( icons ); </code></pre>   that also works great.  the only thing failing right now is how to list the base directory assets.,android

how to declare an object without defining it at the same time in the cpp file  class a has two constructors:   <pre><code>a:a(int  bool) a:a(int int bool) </code></pre>   i d like to achieve something like this:   <pre><code>if (condition)    a object(int bool); else    a object(int int bool);  proess(object); </code></pre>   but as you know there is a problem since the scope of object is only inside the <code>if...else...</code>    so is there a way to achieve this  i dont want to put <code>process()</code> inside the <code>if...else...</code> neither do i want to use <code>a *pobject</code>.     i guess in another word  my question is  how to declare an object without define it,c++
checkboxes like radio-buttons in angular and ionic  i have a list of ionic checkboxes  if i click one i want the others to be deselected. here is an example of the list :    <pre><code> &lt;ion-checkbox  ng-model= creditcard  ng-change= p_method() &gt;             credit card  &lt;/ion-checkbox&gt;  &lt;ion-checkbox  ng-model= cash  ng-change= p_method() &gt;             cash  &lt;/ion-checkbox&gt;  &lt;ion-checkbox  ng-model= check  ng-change= p_method() &gt;             check  &lt;/ion-checkbox&gt; </code></pre>   in my controller i started writing something like this:   <pre><code>  function p_method(){      $scope.creditcard = $scope.creditcard === true   false : true;      $scope.cash = $scope.cash === true   false : true;      $scope.check = $scope.check === true   false : true;        ...........     } </code></pre>   edit:    i could use radio-buttons but they can’t be all deselected.,angularjs
update statements containing multiple sets  i m a bit confused on why i m seeing a difference between the two statements. i m trying to simply increment an int column by 1  so setting values to 1  2  3  4  etc.:    query #1 produces the desired result:   <pre><code>declare @a int set @a = 0 update #jc_temp  set num = @a  @a=@a+1   </code></pre>   query #2 sets all rows to 0:   <pre><code>declare @a int set @a = 0 update #jc_temp  set num = @a set @a=@a+1   </code></pre>   obviously i m missing something here  but to the naked eye they appear to be the same. does the local variable rollback somehow in the 2nd query,sql

mysql - similar headings - multiple tables  i have 2 tables  one containing the main information with a second table containing the same fields plus additional. the second table would have data which should overwrite the first table when queried. the fields are bigger  i ve just shortened them down to show here.    first table (products):   <pre><code>+----+--------------+--------------+---------------+--------------------------+ | id | manufacturer | product_name | product_title |      product_description | +----+--------------+--------------+---------------+--------------------------+ |  1 |     testinga |     producta | producttitlea | main product description | |  2 |     testinga |     productb | producttitleb | main product description | |  3 |     testinga |     productc | producttitlec | main product description | +----+--------------+--------------+---------------+--------------------------+ </code></pre>   second table (products_secondary)   <pre><code>+----+------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------------------+---------+ | id | product_id | manufacturer | product_name | product_title |  product_description | context | +----+------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------------------+---------+ |  1 |          1 |       (null) |       (null) |        (null) | new description here |    test | +----+------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------------------+---------+ </code></pre>   my aim is to select the values from the second table where <code>context = text</code>    expected result:   <pre><code>+----+--------------+--------------+---------------+--------------------------+ | id | manufacturer | product_name | product_title |      product_description | +----+--------------+--------------+---------------+--------------------------+ |  1 |     testinga |     producta | producttitlea | new description here     | |  2 |     testinga |     productb | producttitleb | main product description | |  3 |     testinga |     productc | producttitlec | main product description | +----+--------------+--------------+---------------+--------------------------+ </code></pre>   the query which i know works is the following:   <pre>select ifnull(`products_secondary`.`product_description`   `products`.`product_description`) as `product_description` from `products` left join `products_secondary` on `products_secondary`.`product_id` = `products`.`id` and `products_secondary`.`context` =  test </pre>   i m sure there is an easier way to do this than having to supply ifnull() for each field. here is an sql fiddle: <a href= http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/6985b/1  rel= nofollow >http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/6985b/1</a>    thanks.,mysql
backstack doesn t work when using actionbaractivity as opposed to activity  so i have an app with just a few activities and many fragments that are being replaced into the mainactivity layout. this is pretty straight forward.   <pre><code>                fragmentmanager fragmentmanager = fragment.getfragmentmanager();                 fragmenttransaction transaction = fragmentmanager.begintransaction();                  myfragment f = myfragment.newinstance();                  transaction.replace(r.id.container  f);                 transaction.addtobackstack(null);                 transaction.commit(); </code></pre>   when mainactivity extends activity  everything works just fine. but i changed this to actionbaractivity  in order to implement toolbar  and suddenly the backstack does activities only.    the strange thing is  on android 4.x it still works. on 5.x  the fragments are skipped.    any ideas,android

mysql error #1146 can t get rid of deleted tables  i know #1146 has been asked too many times  but my case is a bit different  so please bear with me.    i was trying to delete a database  libdb_bak  as i no longer need the backup db  however  some error happened and phpmyadmin asked me to create something related to  pma  thing - i didn t paid attention to the details  and after confirming the operation  i go on to my other tasks.    after returning to phpmyadmin  the operation seems failed  so i go to c:\appserv\mysql\data\ to delete the database manually  now every time i tried to go into any database  it will fail with error message regarding  libdb_bak.pma_tracking  doesn t exists.    i tried uninstalling appserv (appserv: 8.6.0 includes mysql:5.7.17  phpmyadmin: 4.6.6) and deleted the whole appserv directory (clean delete  nothing left in recycle bin)  restart pc  re-install appserv  and the problem still exists - it is still looking for the libdb_bak.pma_tracking file  which  it is not supposed to remember  since i already done a clean wipe and fresh re-install.    can anyone help me to locate the residue of this file location memory  so that i can get rid of it for good  i can t use my pc to continue my work  as long as this problem still exists. thanks in advance.,mysql

which is better initializing global/static variables to zero or keep them uninitialized  1) while declaring global &amp; static variables  should we initialize them to 0  though by default they will be initialized to 0  is there any recommended approach      2) should we keep them uninitialized (where they go to bss section) or initialize them to 0 (where they go to data section of memory)  will that (which area of memory they go to) have any impact  will keeping them uninitialized result in small size of binary image of program (if yes  please let me know how it will result in small size &amp; can this be a reason to keep them uninitialized)     3) does c coding standard say anything about it  or there are any pros &amp; cons of preferring one approach over the another,c

application functionality changes when run on device  i ve found that my application stops its timer when the device goes to the lock screen on actual device  but it works perfectly on the simulator.    is that because i haven t released the app  so an actual device won t let me keep working on the lock screen   or is it a bug in my code     i ve written an <code>nslog()</code> statement to monitor my application s timer action  it keeps working when the simulator goes to the lock screen  but on an actual device it stops.    i m so frustrated because i don t know why there are these differences between the device and the simulator  and i don t know how to solve it.,ios

centering a variable width div in a page  i am trying to centre a varying width div in the centre of a page. i m creating a set of tiles which are set to float in a div so that as many fit in the page width as possible and automatically reconfigure if the page width is expanded or contracted.  this works fine.  but i would also like the div containing the tiles to be in the centre of the page.  having looked at numerous solutions to centering in the forums  none of them seem to work for the scenario i am trying to create. the page is being displayed in an iframe and i wondered if that was the problem  but i tried its own page  with no change.    the basic div structure is shown below.  (full php syntax omitted)   <pre><code>&lt;div class= centre &gt; &lt;!-- div containing the tiles --&gt;   foreach (....) {   /* loop to create each tile */     &lt;div class= summary_tile  style= background-image: image-url &gt; &lt;!-- div for each tile --&gt;       &lt;div style= background: rgba(255 255 255  0.6); &gt; &lt;!-- background to write text over images within each tile --&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;   } &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   the relevant css is shown below.  i have tried various versions (show as centren in the css below) of the class centre and the results are shown in the comments.       <pre><code>div.summary_tile {   width: 200px;   height: 150px;    background-position: center;    background-repeat: no-repeat;   border-style: solid;   border-width: 1px;   border-color: blue;   margin: 10px;   float: left; }  div.centre /* tiles fill width of window - number of tiles in row varies according to window width but not centered */ {   margin: 0 auto; }  div.centre1 /* reduces display to 2 tiles wide  but still not centered - remains fixed when window width reduced - not what i want anyway  but just tried the fixed width to see if it worked */ {   width: 600px;   margin: 0 auto; }  div.centre2 /* tiles fill width of window - number of tiles in row varies according to window     width but not centered */ {   display: flex;   justify-content: center;   text-align; center; }  div.centre3 /* tiles fill width of window - number of tiles in row varies according to window width but not centered */ {   display: flex;   align-items; center;   justify-content: center;   text-align; center; }  div.centre4 /* tiles fill width of window - number of tiles in row varies according to window     width but not centered */ {   display: table;   align-items; center;   justify-content: center;   text-align; center; }  div.centre5 /* tiles fill width of window - number of tiles in row varies according to window     width but not centered */ {   display: inline-block;   text-align; center; }  div.centre6 /* tiles fill width of window - number of tiles in row varies according to window     width but not centered */ {   text-align; center; } </code></pre>   i have also tried an outer containing div with each of the centre class options and no class on the div containing the tiles or with various of the classes  but that doesn t seem to work.  am i trying to do the impossible or just not hit on the correct combination of css statements and divs yet,css

abs(v) faster than (v + mask) ^ mask in python   according to <a href= https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#integerabs  rel= nofollow >this page</a>  one way to compute the integer absolute value (<code>abs</code>) without branching in <a href= /questions/tagged/c  class= post-tag  title= show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;  rel= tag >c</a> is as follows:   <pre class= lang-c prettyprint-override ><code>int v;           // we want to find the absolute value of v unsigned int r;  // the result goes here  int const mask = v &gt;&gt; sizeof(int) * char_bit - 1;  r = (v + mask) ^ mask; </code></pre>   out of curiosity  i wanted to compare it with <code>abs()</code> function in python:   <pre><code>&gt; python -m timeit  v = -13   r = abs(v)  10000000 loops  best of 3: 0.119 usec per loop &gt; python -m timeit  v = -13   mask = v &gt;&gt; 23   r = (v + mask)^mask  10000000 loops  best of 3: 0.18 usec per loop </code></pre>   it seems the <code>abs()</code> has better performance than bitwise operations. why  or am i missing something in my test code     more information about the above test codes:    <code>mask = v &gt;&gt; 23</code>  because of the size of <code>v</code> is <code>24</code> through <code>sys.getsizeof(v)</code>.,python

reading huge data set from database through java using multi-threading program  in my project i am generating a report. this involves huge data transmission from the db.    the logic is like user will give certain criteria based on which first we will fetch parent items from db.there may be 100000 parent items.not only this after getting this items we are gathering child items of this parent items and there detailed details. all to gather this parent and child information we are putting in one response xml.     it is fine for small records. but for huge records it is taking more time. we are using a tool as a back end system.which stores the records.it has its own query set so query optimization did not work.all we have to do it with java.    can any one from the team give some idea how to optimize this.,java

what generates notification for the naturalsize of a video in mpmovieplayer   i have  a video in one tab  and some  data analysis based on the video in another tab. my second  tab depends a lot on the naturalsize of the video. i listen to the notification for the video s naturalsize in my first tab and as soon as i get it i store the naturalsize in a shared object for both the tabs and in viewwillappear of the second tab i use the that value.    my problem is the notification for naturalsize is not generated unless i play the video. how should i go about it      i tried playing and pausing the vidoe in first tab s viewdidload but it doesn t work.       <strong>update:</strong> although there is no direct solution for generating the notification but please checkout my answer for a workaround where you don t need to be dependent on the notification at all when you are not streaming a remote video and it s locally available.,ios

accessing a struct field in adjacent to a conditional expression  why there is a difference between the 2 next code segments:   <pre><code>struct g {     int m[100]; };   struct a {     struct g ttt[40];     struct g hhh[40]; }man;   extern int bar(int z);   //this code generate a call to memcopy. void foo1(int idx){     bar(((idx == 5)   man.hhh[idx+7] : man.ttt[idx+7]).m[idx+3]); }  //this code doesn t generate a call to memcopy.     void foo2(int idx){     bar(((idx == 5)   man.hhh[idx+7].m[idx+3] : man.ttt[idx+7].m[idx+3])); } </code></pre>   in both codes segment i want to send the same field (depends on the conditional expression) to bar function. however one the first code generate a call to memcopy (when compiled with clang to powerpc arch it can be seen clearly). i wrote a little main and run the 2 functions and they gave me the same output (compiled with gcc 4.4.7).,c

listbox instantly deselects when i click it in asp.net  it s inside an updatepanel  as it gets updated in response to another drop down box.    i suspect when i click it  it is posting back or something  which is causing it to de-select. do you know how i can stop it from doing this  as the selecteditemchanged event is a trigger for another update panel  and when it triggers it errors because selectedindex is -1 (because it deselects instantly when i click it)    edit: turning off autopostback fixes it  but then it no longer works as a trigger...,asp.net

i am confused as to the data type  i am working on a hack reactor prep-program problem  the problem is listed below.  my question is what is the data type of the customerdata   it appears to be an object  but each property is preceded by a name  joe  and then a key-value pair.  i think of a javascript object as having properties with key-value pairs.    the problem:    write a function called  greetcustomer .    given a name   greetcustomer  returns a greeting based on how many times that customer has visited the restaurant.  please refer to the customerdata object.     the greeting should be different  depending on the name on their reservation.   <pre><code>case 1 - unknown customer ( name is not present in customerdata ):   var output = greetcustomer( terrance ); console.log(output); // --&gt;  welcome! is this your first time    case 2 - customer who has visited only once (  visits  value is 1 ):  var output = greetcustomer( joe ); console.log(output); // --&gt;  welcome back  joe! we re glad you liked us the first time!   case 3 - repeat customer: (  visits  value is greater than 1 ):  var output = greetcustomer( carol ); console.log(output); // --&gt;  welcome back  carol! so glad to see you again!   notes: * your function should not alter the customerdata object to update the number of visits. * do not hardcode to the exact sample data. this is a bad idea:   if (firstname ===  joe ) {   // do something }  starter code : */  var customerdata = {    joe : {     visits: 1   }     carol : {     visits: 2   }     howard : {     visits: 3   }     carrie : {     visits: 4   } };  function greetcustomer(firstname) {   var greeting =   ;   // your code here    return greeting; } </code></pre>,javascript

how to reinitialise angular  i have an angular app which uses many services to hold user data. however  when i sign out and sign in another user again  because these services are singleton and didn t get chance to initialise  therefore  these data which is for the previous user still there.     what i can do is emit a  signed-in  message after sign-in   and write a listen in each services to re-initialise  but that is too much effort.     so i　am thinking if there is a way to re-initialise all services or the whole angular app. i know redirect will do this job  but is there a better way     thanks  ron,angularjs

forcing a jquery ready block to run after all other ready blocks  is it possible to have one jquery ready block executed after all others have done so.    i have this in my master page ...   <pre><code>&lt;script type= text/javascript &gt;     $(document).ready(function()     {         $( input[type= text ]:enabled:first   document.forms[0]).focus().select();     }); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   and this in one of my other pages ...   <pre><code>&lt;script type= text/javascript &gt;     $(document).ready(function()     {         $( textarea.message-body ).wysiwyg();     }); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   the problem i am seeing is that the first block is executed before the second block  which is causing a problem with the tab key. what s happening is that the keyboard focus goes to the address bar in my browser when i press the tab key. i ve changed the code slightly to have this in my master page ...   <pre><code>&lt;script type= text/javascript &gt;     $(document).ready(function()     {         var bodies = $( textarea.message-body );         if (bodies.length &gt; 0)         {             bodies.wysiwyg();         }          $( input[type= text ]:enabled:first   document.forms[0]).focus().select();     }); &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   and do away with the other ready block completely. doing that makes the tab key work properly  and set the focus onto my textarea.    i d rather not have page specific code in my master page.    so  is there a way to make my textbox focusing code run after the wysiwyg code,jquery

is it valid to use a simple return to send back data from an angularjs factory   i have the following two ways and they both seem to work:   <pre><code>angular.module( adminapp ) .factory( testaccount   function ($http) {     return {         get: function (applicationid) {             return $http({                 method:  get                   url:  /api/testaccounts/getselect                   params: { applicationid: applicationid }             });         }     } });  //angular.module( adminapp ) //.factory( testaccount   function ($http) { //    var testaccount = {}; //    testaccount.get = function (applicationid) { //        return $http({ //            method:  get   //            url:  /api/testaccounts/getselect   //            params: { applicationid: applicationid } //        }); //    }; //    return testaccount; //}); </code></pre>   the second method came from an answer to a question i asked on stackoverflow. the first way was some changes i made to it.     can someone tell me which is the more conventional way and if there is any difference between these two. for me the first way seems a bit more clean but i am not sure if i am missing out on some functionality by using it.     i used the following to call the service in both cases:   <pre><code>    testaccount.get(3).then(function (result) {         $scope.testaccounts = result.data;     }  function (result) {         alert( error: no data returned );       }); </code></pre>,angularjs

query on angular resource returns all elements instead of the ones matching the parameter string  in my controller i have the following function:   <pre><code>$scope.filterbyweek = function(week) {     results.query({ week: week }  function(results){         $scope.results = results;     }); }; </code></pre>   in my view i call the function in an ng-click:   <pre><code>&lt;li ng-repeat= week in calendarweeks &gt;     &lt;span ng-click= filterbyweek(week) &gt;{{week}}&lt;/span&gt; </code></pre>   when i click on one of the weeks  it just returns all of them  as if the <code>{ week: week }</code> condition wasn t even present.    however  if i use a <code>filter</code> and explicitly say <code>| filter:{ week:  one  }</code> for instance  it works just fine. i don t want to use this approach though because it loads everything in the dom. i want the controller to pass through what is defined by the <code>filterbyweek</code> function.    any ideas on what s going wrong      the resultsservice if needed:   <pre><code>angular.module( myapp )     .factory( results   function($resource) {         return $resource( /api/results/:_id );     }); </code></pre>,angularjs

how can an integer variable show a correct value even when the value crosses its range   i have executed this program on 32bit windows 7 os with turbo c/c++ editor.   <pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt; #include&lt;conio.h&gt;  void main() {     int a b c d e;     clrscr();      a = 25000;     b = 10000;      c = a + b;      printf(  the value of c = %d\n   c );      d = 5000;      e = c - d;      printf(  the value of e is %d\n   e );      getch(); } </code></pre>   when i print c i get the value -30536  because the value 35000 crosses the max value. but when i use the same c in the expression  e= c - d;    i get the correct value as 30000. how is this possible,c

getting directory of program when called from a different application  i have program1 on my desktop. program1 is supposed to open program2. i have program2 in \folder1\folder2.     so everything looks like this:    program 1 = on desktop    program 2 = \folder1\folder2\program2.exe    i m using this code in program1 to open program2:   <pre><code> process.start( z:\folder1\folder2\program2.exe ) </code></pre>   so  once program2 is open  it is find the path of a file that s contained in folder1 using this code:   <pre><code> dim path as string= system.io.directory.getparent(environment.currentdirectory).tostring() </code></pre>   so we open program1. program1 opens program2. program2 opens a file one directory down  in folder1.    when i execute program2 directly  everything works. however  when i launch program1  it opens program2 which for whatever reason  thinks that the directory is that of program1.    any ideas,.net
same average function c++  i m trying to compare averages of an array and to detect if there is any similar averages  for example if i have these averages 25 30 70 30 60 so the function should return true because 30 is twice there  but it seems what i m doing is wrong    <pre><code>bool sameaverage(student array[] int size) {     bool issame=false;      for (int i=0;i&lt;size;i++)     {         for (int j=0;j&lt;size;j++)         {             if (array[i].getaveragegrade==array[j].getaveragegrade)                 issame=true;         }      }      return issame; } </code></pre>   it is showing me a red line under the dot operator,c++
why should this test ever pass  so confused  im following along hartl s ror tutorial and came across the following test code in ch.6  which is not making sense:   <pre><code>require  test_helper   class usertest &lt; activesupport::testcase    def setup     @user = user.new(name:  example user   email:  user@example.com )   end    test  should be valid  do     assert @user.valid    end    test  name should be present  do     @user.name =             assert_not @user.valid    end end </code></pre>   focusing on the last test  name should be present   the @user.name variable is being assigned blank spaces. so wont that make the test fail  no matter what      secondly  what is assert_not  assert is something like  check if this is true .  so assert_not is  check if its false       so the above test is doing the following    <ol> <li> @name is made to be blank spaces </li> <li> check if @name is invalid  </li> <li> yes it is invalid because @name was made to blank spaces in step 1.  </li> </ol>   so confused....,ruby-on-rails

floating dynamic multi-line list items into two columns  i have a dynamic list that i need to lineup nicely into 2 columns using css and i m having a terrible time with it.    the markup similar to this:   <pre><code>&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a is for apples&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;b is for bananas which are yellow in color&lt;/li  &lt;li&gt;c is for cupcakes&lt;/li&gt; .... &lt;/ul&gt; </code></pre>   when i simply give the li s a width and float them to the left they are clearing funny and end up formatted similar to this:   <pre><code>a is for apples        b is for bananas which                        are yellow in color c is for cupcakes      d is for dirtbag </code></pre>   i need the formatting to get the 3rd li directly under the first li - no matter the height of any one of the list items like this:   <pre><code>a is for apples        b is for bananas which c is for cupcake       are yellow in color d is for dirtbag </code></pre>   each li s text is being pulled from a database and i have no control over how long each is.    <em>clarification update</em> - the list may also come out of the database like so:   <pre><code>&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a is for apples that grow on trees&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;b is for boat&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;c is for cupcakes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;d is for dishes - that sure don t wash themselves&lt;/li&gt; .... &lt;/ul&gt; </code></pre>   requiring the formatting:   <pre><code>a is for apples that   b is for boat grow on trees          c is for cupcake d is for dishes -      e is..... that sure don t wash themselves </code></pre>   <em>/clarification</em>    <strong>my backup plan</strong>: the order is not particularly relevant so i have tried to split the list in half and print out the two columns in 2 separate <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> s that floats left with a defined width but with each <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>having a variable height and the database returning between 2-15 items  using that method the bottom of the columns don t consistently look even. i d just rather find a better option if possible :/,css
layout nestedscrollview with recyclerview results in huge decrease in performance  i m using nestedscrollview in my app in order to have the toolbar hide when scrolling on a recyclerview. the problem is when i put the recyclerview inside the nestedscrollview the performance of the recyclerview is very bad  taking long to load and stuttering when scrolling.     here s my xml implementation of the fragment with the recyclerview.   <pre><code>&lt; xml version= 1.0  encoding= utf-8  &gt; &lt;relativelayout xmlns:android= http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android  xmlns:app= http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto  android:layout_width= match_parent  android:layout_height= match_parent &gt;  &lt;android.support.v7.widget.toolbar     android:id= @+id/toolbar      android:layout_width= match_parent      android:layout_height= wrap_content      android:background=  attr/colorprimary      android:theme= @style/themeoverlay.appcompat.dark      android:elevation= 0dp      android:visibility= gone      app:popuptheme= @style/themeoverlay.appcompat.light      app:layout_scrollflags= scroll|enteralways /&gt;  &lt;android.support.v4.widget.nestedscrollview     android:isscrollcontainer= true      android:layout_width= match_parent      android:layout_height= match_parent      android:layout_below= @id/toolbar      android:background= @color/light_gray      app:layout_behavior= @string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior &gt;      &lt;android.support.v7.widget.recyclerview         android:id= @+id/recyclerview          android:layout_width= match_parent          android:layout_height= match_parent          app:layout_behavior= @string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior          android:clickable= true  /&gt;  &lt;/android.support.v4.widget.nestedscrollview&gt;  &lt;/relativelayout&gt; </code></pre>   this is fragment goes inside a viewpager. here s the other layout with the viewpager:   <pre><code>&lt; xml version= 1.0  encoding= utf-8  &gt; &lt;android.support.design.widget.coordinatorlayout xmlns:android= http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android  xmlns:app= http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto  android:id= @+id/coordinatorlayout  android:layout_width= match_parent  android:layout_height= match_parent &gt;  &lt;android.support.design.widget.appbarlayout     android:id= @+id/appbar      android:layout_height= wrap_content      android:layout_width= match_parent      app:elevation= 0dp &gt;      &lt;android.support.v7.widget.toolbar         android:id= @+id/toolbar          android:layout_width= match_parent          android:layout_height= wrap_content          android:background=  attr/colorprimary          android:theme= @style/themeoverlay.appcompat.dark          android:elevation= 0dp          app:popuptheme= @style/themeoverlay.appcompat.light          app:layout_scrollflags= scroll|enteralways &gt;          &lt;textview             android:id= @+id/title              android:layout_width= fill_parent              android:layout_height=  attr/actionbarsize              android:layout_gravity= left|center_vertical              android:layout_weight= 1              android:gravity= left|center_vertical              android:text= @string/app_name              android:textappearance= @style/textappearance.widget.appcompat.toolbar.title              android:textcolor= @color/white              android:textsize= 18sp /&gt;      &lt;/android.support.v7.widget.toolbar&gt;  &lt;/android.support.design.widget.appbarlayout&gt;  &lt;android.support.v4.view.viewpager     android:id= @+id/pager      android:layout_below= @id/appbar      android:layout_width= match_parent      android:layout_height= wrap_content      app:layout_behavior= @string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior &gt;      &lt;android.support.design.widget.tablayout         android:id= @+id/tabs          android:layout_width= match_parent          android:layout_height= wrap_content          android:background= @color/colorprimary          android:visibility= gone          app:tabindicatorcolor= @android:color/white          app:tabmode= scrollable          app:tabselectedtextcolor= @android:color/white          app:tabindicatorheight= 3dp          app:tabtextcolor= @color/white /&gt;  &lt;/android.support.v4.view.viewpager&gt;  &lt;progressbar     android:id= @+id/eventsprogress      android:layout_width= wrap_content      android:layout_height= wrap_content      android:layout_gravity= center /&gt;  &lt;framelayout     android:id= @+id/search_fragment_container      android:layout_width= match_parent      android:layout_height= match_parent      android:layout_margintop=  attr/actionbarsize      /&gt;  &lt;/android.support.design.widget.coordinatorlayout&gt; </code></pre>   removing the nestedscrollview and leaving the recyclerview alone results in much better performance but then i don t have the hiding toolbar.    am i doing something wrong,android

sql select record with max non zero value if exists otherwise select record with zero value  what i would like to do is select a single record per unique timestamp within a given date range from my table.  if multiple records exist for the same timestamp i want to get the maximum non zero record  or if only zero valued records are returned i just want to return one of those zero valued records. the query i have been using  almost  works which is    <code>select timestamp  max(value) from mytable where *conditions*... group by [timestamp] order by [timestamp] asc;</code>    it obviously works well until the returned records are zero s and negative numbers  in which case it returns the zero record since it is greater than the negative records.  in that case i would want to return one of the negative value records rather than the zero record.  if i try to solve that by changing the where statement to   <pre><code>where [value] &lt;&gt; 0 </code></pre>   then i don t get anything if only zero valued records are returned.  my priority is returning a single greatest non zero valued record per timestamp  but if only zero valued records exists then just return one of those  and if only null records exist for the timestamp i would want a single null record returned.,mysql

comparing 8 properties with 3 other properties and setting matches to nil  i have an object called brain    brain has 8 properties that contain an  animal  object.    brain.animal1  brain.animal2  animal3  ... brain.animal8    i then have three other properties called    brain.selectedanimal1  brain.selectedanimal2  brain.selectedanimal3    what i would like to do is loop through all of the 8 animal properties... and if one of those animal properties matches up with selectedanimal1 property  i want to set the animal property to nil.    i only want to set one animal property to nil (i.e. if two of the animal properties match the selectedanimal1 property i only want the first one to be set to nil  not both)    then i want to do the same loop but compare with selectedanimal2 and selectedanimal3 properties and set animal properties to nil if they match with a selectedanimal.    can anyone help with this    i m just not quite good enough yet with objective-c to get this to work without writing about 50 lines of code    so to recap...  i start with 8 animal properties and would like to end with 5 animal properties (3 being set to nil)    thanks in advance,objective-c

how to keep views in scrollview (that are inside a linear layout) that are not visible from being created   i have linear layout inside a scrollview  and i would like to keep those views which are not visible(which are inside the linear layout) from being created until they are either visible or near to being visible. like adjacent to one that is visible.  i don t know if for example if turning off visibility will keep the view from being created(in terms of resources)  or if gone could be used.     update: the reason i am asking this question is because scrolling is taking a heck of a long time when there are say 30 view elements in the linear layout.  these are not large view elements either  about what you would find for a record in a listview.  i should add that the whole scrollview is inside a fragment.    thanks,android

how to merge multiple css rules from duplicated selectors  <h3>precursor:</h3>  <blockquote>    under normal circumstances  i would never do this.  </blockquote>   i have a css file that i am currently collaborating on with another person. i built the file initially  then they have added rules to it after the fact. but  instead of adding rules to selectors that already exist  they have duplicated selectors everywhere. i don t even want to get into how disorganized the file has become. the problem is that the duplicated selectors are spread out all over the file now and it could take some time to sort it out.    anyway  i am currently in the process of trying to clean up the file. i have tried beautify  css format  etc in my editor (st3)  which cleans up fine but still leaves the duplicate selectors. i have tried various online tools like <a href= http://csslint.net/  rel= nofollow >css lint</a>  <a href= http://tools.maxcdn.com/procssor/  rel= nofollow >procssor</a>  <a href= http://www.dirtymarkup.com/  rel= nofollow >dirty markup</a>  <a href= http://www.cleancss.com/  rel= nofollow >cleancss</a> and so far none of these tools give me the desired result.    <strong>is there any way that these selectors can be merged by some other means instead of manually </strong>    here s an example of my situation  just for reference:    <em>i d like to turn this...</em>   <pre><code>.sameclass {   float: left;   width: 100%;   margin: 0;   padding: 0; }  .differentclass {   border: none;   background: black;   padding: 0; }  .sameclass {   font-weight: bold;   font-size: 24px;   display: inline-block; } </code></pre>   <em>into this...</em>   <pre><code>.sameclass {   float: left;   width: 100%;   margin: 0;   padding: 0;   font-weight: bold;   font-size: 24px;   display: inline-block; }  .differentclass {   border: none;   background: black;   padding: 0; } </code></pre>,css
web search in an iphone app  i ve got experience in c/c++ and am trying to now learn objective-c for iphone development.  i have very little web design experience.    i m trying to create an app for a friend s site that accesses a search feature from a website and then display the results in a uitableview.  for example  (this isn t the site i ll be using  but...) using the stackoverflow search function and then being able to format the results (<a href= https://stackoverflow.com/search q=iphone+web+search >https://stackoverflow.com/search q=iphone+web+search</a>) in cells.  i d like to leave out the rest of the content on the page.    i ve only been able to find info about reading xml or rss search results.  otherwise  i could use uiwebview  but that displays the entire site.  are there other classes that i should look into for doing this   any help would be very  very much appreciated!,iphone

permutation on rails routes  i currently have an application that for a set of parameters (location  category  budget  ...) a user can enter a  pretty  url like:   <blockquote>    /location/canada/ontario<br>   /category/primary<br>   /budget/small    </blockquote>   resulting in the respective parameters:   <pre><code>params[:country] ==  canada  and params[:region] ==  ontario  params[:category] ==  primary  params[:budget] ==  small   </code></pre>   i want to allow users to perform searches on multiple parameters at once (with each parameter optional). for example:   <blockquote>    /location/canada/ontario/category/primary/budget/small<br>      /location/canada/ontario/category/primary      /budget/small/category/primary      /category/primary/budget/small  </blockquote>   i understand that this can be achieved using url parameters  but for seo reasons i prefer to add the  pretty  parameters. is this at all possible without listing all possible combination of routes (i have a large number of search-able fields)  i understand that route  globbing  maybe play a roll  but i am not sure how.    thanks.,ruby-on-rails
ios scroll view bounds not equal to superview bounds  i ve got a uiscrollview that has constraints pinning it to the superview s leading and trailing edges (not the margins).  in this scroll view i have a uiimage which i m setting to initially be the full width of the scroll view.  on the iphone 7 this works correctly  the image is full width    however on the iphone 7 plus there is a gap between the edge of the image and the edge of the screen.  the scroll view is full width as when i zoom the image in it does go right to the edge.    i m getting the image to match the scroll view width by setting    <code> imageview.frame = scrollview.bounds imageview.contentmode = .scaleaspectfill </code>    the issue seems to be the scroll view bounds.  on the iphone 7 plus the scroll view width is reported as 375  however the screen width is reported as 414.  on the iphone 7 the scroll view width is 375 and the screen width is also 375.    anyone know why this is   i m sure i m misunderstanding something!,ios

does the order on the where statement hits the performance   does the order you specify when constructing your query affects the performance  or sql does smart filtering.    for example assume i have a table employee with 2 million records:   <pre><code>employee( emp_id  name  dept_id  country_id ) </code></pre>   not let s say i want  to get the id and name for those employees in  country id 500 and dept id 17. not lets say there about 300k  in that dept and about 1million in that country  however the result of those that met both criterions isw 50k.    would it make a perfomance difference if i do:   <pre><code>select * from employees where dept_id = 17 and country_id= 500 </code></pre>   than if i do:   <pre><code>    select *     from employees     where  country_id= 500 and dept_id = 17 </code></pre>   assuming the latter will cut down the table to 1 million then do the rest from there  and  the first query will cut down to 300k and do the 2nd filter from there.    however as mentioned before i m unsure this is how the sql motor handles the query.,sql

what is top.passback() in javascript  i m dealing with some old @ss legacy code that was written 3 or 4 developers ago....  apparently there is some unfinished code and i m getting errors that passback is not a valid function.    the line in question is: <code>top.passback( curctrl   r +     + g +     + b);</code>    i ve done some research and i couldn t find any reference to a javascript function called passback.  i searched the project and couldn t find any references to custom function called passback either.    was passback used a long time ago and has it been depreciated   i ve seen that .opener comes up when i search for passback.  i tried the examples in opener but it says that it returns null...  this project is a little hokey when it comes to popups and screens.  everything is done through a component (no separation).    any ideas,javascript

can i merge two .net datatables  without merging null values  without having to loop through the rows myself   suppose i have two .net datatables populated as follows  where id is the primary key  and where <code>null</code> means a <code>dbnull.value</code> (not the string <code> null </code>):   <pre>     |table a                |           |table b     |id   |column1 |column2 |           |id   |column1 |column2 |     |1    |foo     |10      |           |1    |zzz     |null    |     |2    |baz     |20      |           |2    |null    |99      | </pre>   i want to do a merge of these tables  where the result will be:   <pre>     |id   |column1 |column2 |     |1    |zzz     |10      |     |2    |baz     |99      | </pre>   in other words  i want to merge the data from table b into table a  just like <code>datatable.merge</code> does  but instead of copying the entire row from table b when the ids match  i only want to copy the fields where the data is not null.    i could write my own loops through the rows of both tables to do this  but i m wondering if there is already a method in the libraries  so that i don t have to rewrite my own version of <code>datatable.merge</code>.,.net

clearing javascript object to fix jquery animation  i m working on creating an interactive mobile info page about running injuries and prevention. here s how it s designed to work:     8 icons are aligned on the page. when the user clicks an icon  all other icons with fade away  while the one that was clicked will animate to the top of the screen.     from here  some informative text will appear that associates with that icon (the text is not shown in the jsfiddle. it s not related to my issue).    a back button will also appear along with the text. if the user clicks the back button  the text will disappear and the icon will animate back to its original position.    the moving icon itself is created using jquery <code>clone</code>. animations and styles are applied to the clone  and it s hidden when it goes back to the original spot.    when running the jquery that makes this animation  i store a value <code>pos</code> that keeps the original position of the icon that was clicked. this is so that when the user clicks  back   it will return to the correct spot. <code>pos</code> is an object that stores the <code>left</code> and <code>top</code> values  and therefore accessed via <code>pos.top</code> and <code>pos.left</code>. here s a snippet of this in action. this stores my original position:   <pre><code>$gridimg.click(function() {      ...      $clone = $(this).clone();      var pos = $(this).position();      $clone.css({         position:  absolute           left: pos.left          top: pos.top }); </code></pre>   here s a snippet of the html for each icon (the images have been replace with creepy smileys:   <pre><code>&lt;div class= rice-injury-grid &gt;      &lt;!-- first icon --&gt;          &lt;div data-title= rest  class= grid-img &gt;         &lt;img id= rest-img   alt= rest  src= http://icons.iconseeker.com/png/64/sketchcons-x/smiley-3.png /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;!-- second --&gt;     &lt;div data-title= blister  class= grid-img &gt;         &lt;img id= blister-img  alt= blisters  src= http://icons.iconseeker.com/png/64/sketchcons-x/smiley-3.png /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;!-- third --&gt;         &lt;div data-title= ice  class= grid-img &gt;         &lt;img id= ice-img  alt= ice  src= http://icons.iconseeker.com/png/64/sketchcons-x/smiley-3.png /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;!-- and so on... --&gt; </code></pre>   <strong>my issue is this:</strong> throughout using this app  each time the user chooses an icon  it stores the <code>pos</code> value indefinitely  so now every time i hit the  back  button  the icon returns to each position that s been previously chosen.    i m looking for a way to clear the <code>pos</code> value each time the icon goes back to its original position.    see the <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/yjwkn/  rel= nofollow ><strong>jsfiddle</strong></a> for a demo. go through at least 2 separate icon sequences to see the full effect.,jquery
doubling a variable numerous times  and adding all iterations of the variable together  edited for clarity s sake. i apologize for the confusion :3    okay  so i m following an online cs class  and we re supposed to write a program  in c  that will tell you how much money you d have if you had a penny at the beginning of the month and doubled it every day.    each day you would get double what you had yesterday plus everything from the previous days.    example: you start with .01 and what to calculate a running total by day 3. so the first day is .01  second day is .02  third day is .04. on day 3 you would have 0.01+0.02+0.04 (.09).    the program intends to calculate this process over the duration of any given month (28 - 31 days).    i m having a really hard time trying to implement this. i ve got it doubling it  but i m not sure how to the previously-calculated days together.    here s my code:   <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;math.h&gt;  int main(void) {      /*days represents total days in months*/     /*pens represents the number of pennies on the first day*/      long long days;     long long pens;      do {       printf( enter the number of days in the month:  );       scanf( %llu   &amp;days);     } while(days &lt; 28 || days &gt; 31);          printf( enter the initial number of pennies:  );     scanf( %llu   &amp;pens);      for (int i=0; i&lt;= days-1; i++) {       pens += pow(2 i);       printf( you ll have $%llu\n   pens);     } } </code></pre>   edit2: okay  so i think i fixed it thanks to all your awesome advice. i changed the last part to:   <pre><code>for (int i=0; i&lt;= days-1; i++)         {             pens = pens + (pens * 2);          }         total = pens / 100;         printf( you ll have $%.2f\n   total);      }  </code></pre>   though there is still a slight issue with the output (which  i m thinking  is due to the data type i m using ) it prints out:    you ll have $0.00 you ll have $0.00 you ll have $0.00 you ll have $0.00 you ll have $2.00 you ll have $7.00 you ll have $21.00 you ll have $65.00 you ll have $196.00 you ll have $590.00 you ll have $1771.00 you ll have $5314.00 you ll have $15943.00 you ll have $47829.00 you ll have $143489.00 you ll have $430467.00 you ll have $1291401.00 you ll have $3874204.00    etc.    pretty good  but i m betting it s not that accurate since the first few iterations are 0.00.,c
strange positioning after using mkannotationview centeroffset  in ios 5.0  i first place annotations on the map and also set the centre offset to cgpointmake(0 -annotationview.frame.size.height/2); right after setting the custom image for the annotation in the mapview:viewforannotation: method... after this the pins still appear at the original position which would be the case when the centre offset was not applied.     however  when i pinch or zoom the map  the annotation jumps to the correct position as would be the case with the centeroffset being set and then behaves correctly..     what could be the reason and solution for this     any help would be much appreciated.     baffled!!,ios

ios: can i read from sqlite database in the background   i have an application that is registered for location updates in the background. whenever the location is updated i need to loop through an <code>nsmutablearray</code> of coordinates to see which one is closest to the user.    sometimes for memory reasons  the phone kills my application (though it s still registered to receive location updates)  and along with it my <code>nsmutablearray</code> of coordinates.    so whenever a location update comes in  i have to check if my <code>nsmutablearray</code> of coordinates is still alive  and if not i would like to re-populate it from an sqlite table.    after running a few tests  it would appear that the re-population of my coordinate array from the sqlite table is not happening  here is my code that runs whenever the location updates:   <pre><code>bgtask = [[uiapplication sharedapplication]beginbackgroundtaskwithexpirationhandler:^{[[uiapplication sharedapplication] endbackgroundtask:bgtask]}];  if(coordarray == nil || coordarray.count == 0) {     [self readcoordinatesfromdatabase]; } else {     //check which coordinate is closest to the user. }  if(bgtask != uibackgroundtaskinvalid) {     [[uiapplication sharedapplication] endbackgroundtask:bgtask];     bgtask = uibackgroundtaskinvalid; } </code></pre>   am i not allowed to read from sqlite in this case     i absolutely need to be able to go through my coordinate array (in the background) whenever a location update occurs  how can i do this even if the application is killed after a period of time,ios

transilerate accents in mysql like like  i have a very long list of users. i want to group them by first letter of name. if the first letter is not a letter  it s grouped under <code>#</code>  so i have max 27 groups  for <code>a-z</code> + <code>#</code>.    i want to show only the gorup labels (e.g. <code>f</code>) if it will have results  and for every letter i want to know how many results it will have. so i do a single group query to count all groups:   <pre><code>select   if(lastname regexp  ^[a-z]   upper(substring(lastname  1  1))   # ) first_char    count(1) num_users group by first_char </code></pre>   that seems to work  but using regexp means that <code>ö</code> isn t an <code>o</code>  but a <code>#</code>. that s a problem  because <code>like</code> does find <code> ö  =  o </code>  so it will be in the <code>o</code> group when i <code>name like  o% </code>. i could use regexp in the results query too  but i rather file <code>ö</code> under <code>o</code>.    so the <code>like</code> query works perfectly  but the group query doesn t. how do i do <strong>exactly</strong> what <code>like</code> does during comparisons   so the group numbers and results always perfectly match.    or another way to count correctly     <strong>edit 1</strong>    using <code>like a or like b or .. or like z</code> in the <code>if</code> doesn t even work  because then the group might be <code>ö</code> instead of <code>o</code>. the numbers will be correct  but the group label won t be. i really need a conversion...    <strong>edit 2</strong>    thanks to @mpen. <code>lastname regexp  ^[[:alpha:]] </code> is shorter than 26 <code>like</code>s  but the <code>ö</code> label problem remains. converting that outside mysql is easy though.,mysql

tab state control angularjs  so i am relatively new to angularjs and i am trying to figure out the best way for a tabcontroller to remember what tab was previously clicked when switching to a new controller. so the situation would be i have 3 tabs. i click on tab 3 and then i click on something inside of it bringing me to a new controller and html template... what is the best way if i hit a  back  button i created in that controller to remember exactly the state of it being the 3 tab.    i tried using $rootscope and then in each controller setting the tab number and setting the tabcontroller = $rootscope... but that was chaotic and too repetitive.,angularjs

rails: appropriate / conventional way to act on notifications  i ve built a stripe saas app a bit like byron bowerman s <a href= https://github.com/bm5k/stripe-example  rel= nofollow >stripe-example</a>.     notifications from stripe are called  webhooks   and include information like whether payments have succeeded or failed.  in my app they are received by the <a href= https://github.com/integrallis/stripe_event  rel= nofollow >stripe-event gem</a> which then passes the information to a webhook model to be saved in the database.    i want to use these events to trigger actions:   <ul> <li>email to user</li> <li>update user model</li> <li>etc.</li> </ul>   the question is which class should take these actions  and how should it be informed     there are a few options:    <strong>1) within webhook model</strong>    easy  but feels outside what responsibility of this class should be.    <strong>2) webhook observer(s)</strong>    one observer  or separate ones for different actions     <strong>3) rails notifications</strong>    the webhook model could send out an <code>activesupport::notification</code> each time it receives a webhook.  this could be subscribed to by a class anywhere in the application.  if i went this route would it be appropriate to do this in the user model  the userscontroller  or somewhere else     a worry i have with this approach is that in his <a href= http://railscasts.com/episodes/249-notifications-in-rails-3 view=asciicast  rel= nofollow >railscast on notifications</a> ryan bates recommends that  notifications are best used for logging and for code that doesn’t modify the application’s core behaviour.     <strong>4) ... </strong>    what do you advise,ruby-on-rails

database connection and querying in asp.net  okay  so after about an hour of searching through the web  i m still having issues trying to create a local db connection in asp.net.     i need to create a connection to a local database file  and then simply loop through each record in a table. i m not sure which file extension to use here (.aspx  .vbhtml  .cshtml )    this is what i currently have from this <a href= http://www.w3schools.com/website/webpages_database.asp  rel= nofollow >w3school</a> tutorial    <pre><code>  create local connection to db file @{ var db = database.open( properties.mdf );  var query = db.query( select * from properties );  }      &lt;div id= pagewrap &gt;            loop through records         @foreach(var row in query)         {          &lt;p&gt;@row.streetaddress&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;@row.city&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;p&gt;@row.state&lt;/p&gt;           }      &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   i m currently getting a <code>connection string  properties.mdf  was not found.</code> error when running the above code. any help is greatly appreciated.,asp.net

the weirdest css issue i have ever seen  below i have 2 css codes for a div  please note that the first one does not even have a div on the page or anything with it s name on it.  i can also rename it to anything.    now where the weird part comes in.  the second bit of code below has a width of 520px  the only way that the div on the page will be 520px is if i leave the css code thats above that one  the 1st one with no existing div on the page has to be on the page for the second css code to work  at first i thought it has to be a browser caching issue  so i clear my cache and that does nothing  i then try 2 other browsers and they all have the same result.    i add the 1st bit of code into the page and the second bit works  i take the first bit away and the second bit does not work.  am i overlooking something here    <pre><code>.commentwrappsdfsde2{width:950px;margin:0 0;padding:0;}  .commentwrapper{width:520px;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;} </code></pre>   here is the whole page code   <pre><code>&lt;style&gt; &lt;!-- css for user photos--&gt; div.imagesub img.female { border-top: 1px solid #ff3399; } div.imagesub img.male { border-top: 1px solid #3399ff; } div.imagesub img { z-index: 1; margin: 0; display: block; } div.imagesub div {     position: relative;     margin: -15px 0 0;     padding: 5px;     height: 5px;     line-height: 4px;     text-align: center;     overflow: hidden;  font-family:trebuchet ms helvetica sans-serif;  font-size:12px;  font-weight: bold; } div.imagesub div.blackbg {     z-index: 2;     background-color: #000;     -ms-filter:  progid:dximagetransform.microsoft.alpha(opacity=70) ;     filter: alpha(opacity=70);     opacity: 0.5; } div.imagesub div.label {     z-index: 3;     color: white; } &lt;!-- end photo block--&gt; /* comments */ .commentwrappsdfsde2{width:950px;margin:0 0;padding:0;} .commentwrapper{width:520px;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;} #comments ol.commentlist li { list-style-type:none; padding:20px; background:none; } #comments ol.commentlist li.thread-even { background:#f6f6f6; border-top:1px solid #e3e3e3; border-bottom:1px solid #e3e3e3; }  #comments ul.children li ul.children #comments .commentlist{padding:0;} &lt;/style&gt;  &lt;div class= commentwrapper &gt;  &lt;div id= comments &gt;   &lt;ol class= commentlist &gt;    &lt;li class= comment thread-even   &gt;      comment 1     &lt;/li&gt;   &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>,css
malloc array  is there a logical meaning about the values ​in my array   i used malloc for allocating 1 byte of an unsigned char to the variable pointer  after i printed with two for the contents of the memory cells  here is my code:   <pre><code>#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;  int main(int argc  char**argv){  unsigned char *pointer; int sz=1  min=-4  max=20;  printf( allocating %d unsigned chars  min=%d  max=%d\n\n  sz min max); pointer = (unsigned char*)malloc(sz); if ( pointer == null ) {     printf( could not allocate pointer\n );     exit(0);   } printf( *pointer=%hhu\n  *pointer); { int i;   for ( i = -1 ; i &gt;= min ; i-- )     printf( pointer[%d]=%hhu\n  i pointer[i]);   for ( i = 1 ; i &lt;= max ; i++ )     printf( pointer[%d]=%hhu\n  i pointer[i]); } exit(0); } </code></pre>   my output:   <pre><code>allocating 1 unsigned chars  min=-4  max=20  *pointer=0 pointer[-1]=0 pointer[-2]=0 pointer[-3]=0 pointer[-4]=17 pointer[1]=0 pointer[2]=0 pointer[3]=0 pointer[4]=0 pointer[5]=0 pointer[6]=0 pointer[7]=0 pointer[8]=0 pointer[9]=0 pointer[10]=0 pointer[11]=0 pointer[12]=137 pointer[13]=26 pointer[14]=2 pointer[15]=0 pointer[16]=0 pointer[17]=0 pointer[18]=0 pointer[19]=0 pointer[20]=0 </code></pre>   if i do not wrong the malloc() function allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. the memory is not initialized. if size is 0  then malloc() returns either null... does malloc take a starting address and creates a series of contingent cells  is the content of the memory cells random or does it make logical sense  for example pointer[-4]= 17   why is there 17   pointer[12]=137   why is there 137       edit: i tried the program on different machines and i notice a similar behaviour. kernel sets to 0 the memory cells for security reasons but sometimes doesn t write zero values. i m interested in the meaning of those figures. e.g.: 17  137  26... i m sure that they have sense.    thank you.,c

php get function as null  i want to use get in php and i know how to. the only problem is when i start my page i dont have a  var=... on it. for example my site is    <pre><code>http://localhost/q/question.php </code></pre>   and in my code is   <pre><code>$num = $_get[ num ]; </code></pre>   and i want to assume that if $num == null or has not been defined as in the link above.    i will generate a different page. because as example below just determines i am starting the questions in what ever page.    no num variable = start generating questions in array.   <pre><code>http://localhost/q/question.php num=1 </code></pre>,php
how to restore data from appwidgetprovider when reboot the phone   i m making a simple memo widget app. just writing some texts and save it to sharedpreference. everything is okay.. but when my phone is reboot  app widget is turned to be default.    i heard i should do something about boot_complete.. so i add boot_complete permission and intent-filter in manifest. but i have no idea how i can call the onupdate when my phone is reboot. my source is this.. please see the onreceive part..   <pre><code>@override public void onupdate(context context  appwidgetmanager appwidgetmanager          int[] appwidgetids) {     super.onupdate(context  appwidgetmanager  appwidgetids);      for(int i=0; i&lt;appwidgetids.length; i++){         int widgetid = appwidgetids[i];         intent intent = new intent(context  myapppostitactivity.class);         intent.putextra( widgetid   widgetid);         pendingintent pending = pendingintent.getactivity(context  widgetid  intent  pendingintent.flag_update_current);         remoteviews remote = new remoteviews(context.getpackagename()  r.layout.widget);         remote.setonclickpendingintent(r.id.layout  pending);         appwidgetmanager.updateappwidget(widgetid  remote);      }  }//onupdate  @override public void onreceive(context context  intent intent) {     super.onreceive(context  intent);      if(intent.getaction().equals( android.intent.action.boot_completed )){         //i guess i should call the onupdate in here!! but i don t know how..     }   } </code></pre>   after boot_complete  how can i restore my widget s data  i hope any suggestion or clue or samples.. thanks a lot~!,android
comma operator failed to update the input parameter for the base class construction  i have the following code  which takes advantage of the comma operator in the initialization list.   <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;  using namespace std;  class base {     protected:         int b;     public:         base(int a):b(a){} };  class a:public base {     private:         const int i;         const int j;         void inc(int &amp; a  int &amp; b) {a++; b++;}     public:         a(int a  int b):i((inc(a b) a)) j(b) base(a+b){}         void print(){cout&lt;&lt;i&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;j&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;b&lt;&lt;endl;} };  int main() {     a a(6 7);     a.print();     return 0; } </code></pre>   i am expecting the results to be:   <pre><code>7  8  15 </code></pre>   but it turned out to be:   <pre><code>7  8  13 </code></pre>   it seems that  a  and  b  was not incremented when used to construct the base class. not sure why...,c++
does a property within an observablecollection require a propertychangedevent  do properties on an object within an observable collection require a propertychangedevent   for example:   <pre><code>public class myobject {      public int myproperty { get; set;} }  public class myviewmodel {     observablecollection&lt;myobject&gt; myobjects = new observablecollection&lt;myobject&gt;(); } </code></pre>   from what i can tell  if i execute <code>myobjects[0].myproperty = 1;</code>then my binding doesn t occur.  however  if i call <code>myobjects.add(new myobject());</code> the binding does occur.,.net
angularjs permits update of a single(first) row for sub comments of each post  angularjs having issues in updating each subcommets/subpost of inputted data.    i have a json file which contains <strong>two posts</strong>. the <strong>first post</strong> contains ** three** subposts(subcomment) each with an update button.  the <strong>second post</strong> contains <strong>two</strong> subpost(subcomment) each with an update button.    my intention was to allow user to input any values corresponding to each rows under each post so the new inputed data will replace the already existing data in the angular js view for that row.    the problem is that only the first row of each subcomment for that post gets updated when data is posted.    for instance in <strong>post 1</strong>  if you enter a value at the <strong>first row</strong> and submit  it will update the already existing <code>{{comment.subcomment}}</code> data of the first row.  if you input on row 2 for the same <strong>post 1</strong>  it will update the first row of post 1 instead of second row of that post.    some stackoverflow scholars like <strong>ntp</strong> in the link below <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50785966/angularjs-allows-data-updates-only-for-the-first-rows/50791338#50791338 >angularjs allows data updates only for the first rows</a>    suggested solution that since the code has 2 <code>ng-repeats</code> and <code>$index</code> passes the index of the inner ng-repeat whereas one need the index of the outer <code>ng-repeat</code>. he concluded that if one modify code to take the index of outer <strong>ng-repeat</strong> as following  it should solve the issue.    1) first add this ng-init to your outer ng-repeat   <pre><code>&lt;div ng-repeat= post in posts track by $index  ng-init= outerindex=$index &gt; </code></pre>   2) use outerindex in your save function   <pre><code>&lt;input type= button  id= but_save  value= save and replace/update  ng-click= setresponse4(post.id 1 outerindex subcomment comment.id) &gt; </code></pre>   but the solution above only updates first inputed values of the of the first subcomment row for each post.  if you input on row 2 for the same  it will update the first row of that post instead of second row of that post for which the button was clicked.    below is the code    js   <pre><code>var app = angular.module( plunker   []);

stop activityindicator in embedded tableview cell upon return from detail viewcontroller  i have a viewcontroller that has a container view.  in the container view i have a tableview that contains static cells.  each cell has a disclosure indicator.  this was all created in ib.  the parent viewcontroller is embedded in a navigationcontroller.    each cell pushes a new view controller which loads a mapview. each map parses and loads a .kml file.  the .kml files are huge and take up to a minute (or more) to load.    i placed an activityindicator in the accessory view of each cell using the following code:   <pre><code>- (void)tableview:(uitableview *)tableview didselectrowatindexpath:(nsindexpath *)indexpath{  uitableviewcell *cell = [tableview cellforrowatindexpath:indexpath];  uiactivityindicatorview *activityview = [[uiactivityindicatorview alloc]initwithactivityindicatorstyle:uiactivityindicatorviewstylegray]; [activityview startanimating]; [cell setaccessoryview:activityview];  [self.tableview deselectrowatindexpath:[self.tableview indexpathforselectedrow] animated:yes];} </code></pre>   this appears to work as expected.    after viewing the map i touch the  back  button provided by the navigationcontroller and pop the map off the stack.  my embedded tableview is visible again  with the activity indicator still spinning.  i can t get it to stop.    my best attempt was in the implementation file of my tableview:   <pre><code>- (void)viewwillappear:(bool)animated{ [super viewwillappear:animated]; [[self tableview] reloaddata];} </code></pre>   but that didn t work.  any suggestions,ios

angularjs: how change icon when item is clicked  i know that this question has already some answers/solutions but none of them works for me most probably because this is the first time when i m trying to implement something using angularjs.    i have a <code>div</code> (title) that expands some info when it s clicked and i want to change the icon inside of it when that info is visible...    this is my code:   <pre><code>&lt;div class= title  ng-click= view_variables(request) &gt;     &lt;i class= glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right &gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   and this is what i tried to do  but not working because the div will not show the expanded info anymore:   <pre><code>&lt;div class= title  ng-click= view_variables(request) = !view_variables(request) &gt;     &lt;i ng-class= { glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right :!view_variables(request)   glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left : view_variables(request)} &gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   controller code:   <pre><code>$scope.view_variables = function(req){     if (!req.enabled_variables &amp;&amp; !req.disabled_variables) {         $http.get( /api/files/  + $scope.file_id +  /requests/  + req.id +  /variables )         .success(function(data){             variables = data.data;             req.enabled_variables = [];             req.disabled_variables = [];             for (i=0; i&lt;variables.length; i++) {                 if (variables[i].disabled == true) {                     req.disabled_variables.push(variables[i]);                 } else {                     req.enabled_variables.push(variables[i])                 }             }         });     }      req.show_variables = !req.show_variables; } </code></pre>,angularjs

fstream end of file question  i am reading in multiple files. there are roughly 300 of these files. for some reason  if i set the loop to run over 3 iterations  the while loop which is supposed to iterate through each line becomes infinite. my question is: is there somthing i am forgetting to include in my while loop  for now i am simply trying to read one line at a time  eventually saving some data in the output file. or is it possible that there is something contained in the data files that is not letting the program reach the end of the file     <pre><code>ifstream infile; ofstream outfile; char outputfilename[] =  output.txt ; int i;  outfile.open(outputfilename  ios::out);  for (i = 1; i &lt; 4; i++) {     stringstream inputfilename;     inputfilename &lt;&lt;  data/  &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt;  .txt ;     infile.open(inputfilename.str().c_str()  ios::in);     if (!infile) {         cout &lt;&lt;  error opening input files  &lt;&lt; endl;         exit(-1);     }      char buffer[256];     while (!infile.eof()) {         cout &lt;&lt;  hey ;         infile.getline(buffer  100);     }     infile.close(); } outfile.close(); </code></pre>   update: this works much better   <pre><code>char buffer[256];     while (!infile.eof()) {       infile &gt;&gt; buffer;     } </code></pre>,c++

event when angularjs finished changing dom  i have some angularjs code which sets up some scope fields very quickly  but then takes angularjs and/or chrome a long time to create and render the dom. this is mainly due to a few ng-repeat bindings to long lists in the scope. the browser freezes for a couple of seconds whilst preparing and rendering the dom.    i d like to know when the browser has finished  so that i can display a loading sign whilst the browser is busy  and then display the resulting dom once it has finished. what techniques are available for achieving this,angularjs
how to make a custom drawn uitableviewcell resize properly   for performance reasons  i draw the strings for my uitableviewcell in a custom view that overrides its drawrect method to draw strings directly in the view rectangle using nsstring:drawinrect. this is similar to apple s tableviewsuite example 5-customtableviewcell.    however  when i invoke setediting on the cell to bring up the delete button  the view ends up with a squeezed appearance after the animation completes. to demonstrate this  invoke setediting:yes on the customtableviewcell example mentioned above and observe the distortion. is there any way around this or should i just revert back to using uilabels for my text,iphone

asp.net dropdownlist mantains only certain values through postback  i m trying to figure out what s going on with a project i m developing for a big bottling customer. there is a main query that selects a range of products  and four subqueries (one for each dropdownlist) that select four common characteristics on this list (flavour  packaging  format and brand) for filtering purposes. when i select one of the values in a dropdownlist  after the postback only some values are mantained. i ve removed from the aspx page all the scripts and controls  and i ve left only the dropdownlists  and i ve populated only one of them (the brand list  you can imagine from the values how much important can be this customer...). the subquery extracts the following values :   <ul> <li>$$ nessuno</li> <li>a coca-cola</li> <li>b fanta</li> <li>c sprite</li> <li>d kinley</li> <li>g1 amita</li> <li>l burn</li> <li>q1 tepelene</li> </ul>   when i select one of these values  only the last three are mantained; if i select one of the other the dropdownlist always select the first one. this is also confirmed by a breakpoint on the selectedindexchange event that inspects the selectedindex value of the dropdownlist. if i populate another dropdownlist that has more elements  the selection is mantained only from index 5. in every list the five first elements seems to be ignored. i can confirm  with a breakpoint on the page_load event  that the lists are not re-binded on each postback. this is the remaining aspx page :   <pre><code>&lt;%@ page language= c#  autoeventwireup= true  codebehind= ~/wpgeo/wpimagepopup.aspx.cs  inherits= webgeoref.wpgeo.wpimagepopup  enableeventvalidation= false  %&gt;

linearization of android sensor data (accelerometer)  i m working on my research to detect user s foot step accurately using sensors in android phone. i mainly used the accelerometer sensor to detect the foot step. i used a method to get accelerometer data and searching for a method to remove unwanted noise of the accelerometer data. i have found that linearization of data is a good method. but i have no much clear idea how to do it. i think its kind of getting median value. so i didn t find a method to get median value in real-time manner. can anyone suggest me a better lenearization method to remove noise of accelerometer data.     here is my code.(i have used a nchart library to draw my accelerometer data in a chart.)   <pre><code>package com.android.gait;  import org.achartengine.graphicalview;  import android.hardware.sensor; import android.hardware.sensorevent; import android.hardware.sensoreventlistener; import android.hardware.sensorlistener;  import android.hardware.sensormanager; import android.os.bundle; import android.app.activity; import android.content.context; import android.view.menu; import android.view.view; import android.widget.linearlayout; import android.widget.relativelayout; import android.widget.textview;  public class mainactivity extends activity implements sensoreventlistener{      private int count=0;     private static graphicalview view;     private linegraph line = new linegraph();     private static thread thread;     private sensormanager msensormanager;     private sensor maccelerometer;     textview title tv tv1 tv2;     relativelayout layout;     private static point p; static float m = 0;      @override     protected void oncreate(bundle savedinstancestate) {         super.oncreate(savedinstancestate);         setcontentview(r.layout.activity_main);          //get the sensor service            msensormanager = (sensormanager) getsystemservice(context.sensor_service);            //get the accelerometer sensor            maccelerometer = msensormanager.getdefaultsensor(sensor.type_accelerometer);            //get layout            layout = (relativelayout)findviewbyid(r.id.relative);            linearlayout layout = (linearlayout) findviewbyid(r.id.layoutc);            view= line.getview(this);             layout.addview(view);             //get textviews            title=(textview)findviewbyid(r.id.name);            tv=(textview)findviewbyid(r.id.xval);            tv1=(textview)findviewbyid(r.id.yval);            tv2=(textview)findviewbyid(r.id.zval);             thread = new thread(){              int inix=0;                  public void run()                {                  while(true)                  {                       try {                         thread.sleep(1);                     } catch (interruptedexception e) {                         // todo auto-generated catch block                         e.printstacktrace();                     }                     inix=+1;                       line.addnewpoint(inix m);                      view.repaint();                     }                  }                };             thread.start();       }        public final void onaccuracychanged(sensor sensor  int accuracy)        {          // do something here if sensor accuracy changes.        }     @override      public final void onsensorchanged(sensorevent event)        {         count=+1;         // many sensors return 3 values  one for each axis.        float x = event.values[0];        float y = event.values[1];        float z = event.values[2];         //get merged value         m = (float) math.sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z);          // p =mockdata.getdatafromreceiver(count  m);          //display values using textview        title.settext(r.string.app_name);        tv.settext( x axis  + \t\t +x);        tv1.settext( y axis  +  \t\t  +y);        tv2.settext( z axis  + \t\t  +z);        }      @override     protected void onresume()     {     super.onresume();     msensormanager.registerlistener(this  maccelerometer  sensormanager.sensor_delay_normal);     }     @override     protected void onpause()     {     super.onpause();     msensormanager.unregisterlistener(this);     }      public void linegraphhandler(view view){        }   } </code></pre>,android

what s the preferred way to assign a collection from a parameter   i have this class:   <pre><code>public myclass {     public void initialize(collection&lt;string&gt; data) {         this.data = data; // &lt;-- bad!     }     private collection&lt;string&gt; data; } </code></pre>   this is obviously bad style  because i m introducing a shared mutable state. what s the preferred way to handle this    <ul> <li>ignore it </li> <li>clone the collection </li> <li>... </li> </ul>   <strong>edit:</strong> to clarify why this is bad  imagine this:   <pre><code>myclass myobject = new myclass(); list&lt;string&gt; data = new arraylist&lt;string&gt;(); myobject.initialize(data); // myobject.data.size() == 0 data.add( test ); // myobject.data.size() == 1  </code></pre>   just storing the reference poses a way to inject data into the private field <code>myobject.data</code>  although it should be completely private.    depending on the nature of <code>myclass</code> this could have serious impacts.,java

splitting of xml file using c#  i am using c# and am creating xml from an external data source and saving the xml as a single xml file.  how can i split the xml up and save it as multiple xml files   for example  say there are 263 records in my xdocument xml.  i need to split that into multiple xml files containing exactly 25 records.  (that s the specs - no way around it.)  so  for this example  i d end up with 11 xml files.    my data source is a xml file   and i have the option of splitting that into chunks of 25 records per xml file  if that is easier.  how would i approach doing it that way,c#
converting dates to a more readable format  given an array of datetime values that have been randomly selected between now and the next 7 days  how do i display relative time values  like:   <ul> <li>in 2 h</li> <li>in 3 d</li> <li>in 1 m</li> </ul>   at the moment  <a href= http://jsbin.com/meripexuru/2/edit  rel= nofollow >my program generates a random datearray</a> with items in the following format  which i would ideally like to pass into a function that will return them into relative time format.   <pre><code>var timelineitemcount = getrandomint(0  19); var datearray = new array();      for(i=0;i&lt;timelineitemcount;i++)     {         var today = new date();         var randomdates = randomdate(today  new date(today.getfullyear()  today.getmonth()  today.getdate()+7));         datearray.push(randomdates);     }        datearray.sort(function compare(a  b)/&gt; {         return (a &lt; b)/&gt; - (a &gt; b)/&gt;;     });     console.log(datearray);  function getrandomint(min  max) {     return math.floor(math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min; }  function randomdate(start  end) {     return new date(start.gettime() + math.random() * (end.gettime() - start.gettime())); } </code></pre>   i have done some research  and so far seen examples on how to calculate relative time with values from the past  but i have not seen so much with values selected between now and the next 7 days. for example:   <pre><code>const int second = 1; const int minute = 60 * second; const int hour = 60 * minute; const int day = 24 * hour; const int month = 30 * day;  var ts = new timespan(datetime.utcnow.ticks - yourdate.ticks); double delta = math.abs(ts.totalseconds);  if (delta &lt; 0) {   return  not yet ; } if (delta &lt; 1 * minute) {   return ts.seconds == 1    one second ago  : ts.seconds +   seconds ago ; } if (delta &lt; 2 * minute) {   return  a minute ago ; } if (delta &lt; 45 * minute) {   return ts.minutes +   minutes ago ; } if (delta &lt; 90 * minute) {   return  an hour ago ; } if (delta &lt; 24 * hour) {   return ts.hours +   hours ago ; } if (delta &lt; 48 * hour) {   return  yesterday ; } if (delta &lt; 30 * day) {   return ts.days +   days ago ; } if (delta &lt; 12 * month) {   int months = convert.toint32(math.floor((double)ts.days / 30));   return months &lt;= 1    one month ago  : months +   months ago ; } else {   int years = convert.toint32(math.floor((double)ts.days / 365));   return years &lt;= 1    one year ago  : years +   years ago ; } </code></pre>,javascript

modify activity after clicking on a notification  i have a normal notification system that looks like this:   <pre><code>notification notification new notification(         r.drawable.alerts_notification          alerttitle          system.currenttimemillis()); intent intent = new intent(mcontext  myactivity.class); intent.setaction(myactivity.one_action); pendingintent pi = pendingintent.getactivity(mcontext  0  intent  0); mnotifman.notify(id  notification); </code></pre>   notice that i m using <code>one_action</code> as the action of the intent. what i do is verify the action on the activity and select one of the tabs (it s a <code>tabactivity</code>).    all that works fine if the activity is closed  because the <code>intent</code> will open the activity and then i will decide what to do depending on the action in the <code>intent</code>. but  if the activity is already opened  it launches a new activity. on the other hand  if i add the flag <code>intent.flag_activity_single_top</code>  the activity is not launched twice but i can t the tab is not chosen either.    so  how can choose a tab by clicking on the notification,android

c# being able to search/manipluate existing richtextboxes that are differently named  with some of the knowledge i gained from yesterday and the day before  i have a general idea of what i want to do. i do have a general question about richtextboxes. i have a gui already made of multiple richtextboxes aligned in different rows of one another. one row of boxes monitors the load of a product  the other monitors if one of the channels have been tripped and the other two rows displays the current and voltage of the product. the gui has been premade and each row of product has been named <code>statusoutxxx  tripstatoutxxx  voltageoutxxx and currentoutxxx</code> (the <code>xxx</code> indicates a number of each richtextbox  like <code>currentout001</code>  for example).    the example gui is listed below:    <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/g2lmz.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/g2lmz.png  alt= enter image description here ></a>    from the image  you can see that i have 4 rows of richtextboxes. the monitoring backend of the product has already been established and i am trying to take the data and turn the product into a user friendly display to let the person now  if the load on a certain channel is okay or if the voltage of a product is too high/low or if a certain channel has been tripped.    now  i know how to turn them all on at once via:   <pre><code>foreach(var rtb in this.controls.oftype&lt;richtextbox&gt;())     rtb.backgroundcolor = color.green; </code></pre>   and i know how to control which ones to turn on via <code>if(rtb.name.startswith( insert prefix here ))</code>. but i am asking a bit of a harder question in terms of searching and manipulating an individual richtextbox.    for example  if there is a load issue on channel 17 of my product that drops my voltage  i want to be able to search for the <code>statusout017</code>  change the backcolor of that to red and change the value of <code>voltageout017</code> to the voltage display.    i know that the long way of doing it is doing a giant if statement for each load  trip and voltage channel to change it  but i am aiming for reducing the amount of lines of code and attempting to doing a for loop so my code will look something like this (in psuedocode):   <pre><code>for (i = 1; i &lt; 25; i++) {     if (statusout[i] == true)     {         statusout[i].backcolor == color.green;     }     else     {         statusout[i].backcolor == color.red;     }      if (tripstatout[i] == true)     {         tripstatout[i].backcolor == color.green;     }     else     {         tripstatout[i].backcolor == color.red;     }      voltageout[i].text = voltagereading;     currentout[i].text = currentreading; } </code></pre>   i am hoping for some help on this one.,c#

is it better to use a custom java object or to use a hashmaps to store data  lets say we have a bunch of data (temp wind pressure) that ultimately comes in as a number of float arrays.  for example:   <pre><code>float[] temp = //get after performing some processing (takes time) float[] wind =  </code></pre>   say we want to store these values in memory for different hours of the day. is it better to put these on a hashmap like:   <pre><code>hashmap maphr1 = new hashmap(); maphr1.put( temp  temp); maphr1.put( wind  wind); ... </code></pre>   or is it better to create a java object like:   <pre><code>public class hourdata(){    private float[] temp wind pressure;    //getters and setters for above!  } ... // use it like this hourdata hr1 = new hourdata(); hr1.settemp(temp); hr1.setwind(wind); </code></pre>   out of these two approaches which is better in terms of performance  readability  good oop practice etc,java

conversion to doublevalue doesn t work .. but to integervalue does  hello all i m trying to convert a string to a double and it doesn t work. however if i convert it to an integer it does work     this is my code snippet   <pre><code>int myduration = [mydurationstring integervalue]; int conversionminute = myduration / 60;              if( myduration &lt; 60 )             {                 [appdelegate.rep1 addobject:[nsstring stringwithformat:@ %d  myduration]];                 nslog(@ show numbers %d   myduration);             }             else             {                 [appdelegate.rep1 addobject:[nsstring stringwithformat:@ %d  conversionminute]];                 nslog(@ show numbers %d   conversionminute);             } </code></pre>   now if i try to do    <pre><code>double myduration = [mydurationstring doublevalue]; double conversionminute = myduration / 60; </code></pre>   then it doesn t work. it gives me an output of 0.     so the integerconversion works but somehow the double doesn t does anybody have an idea why,objective-c

using the distinct function in sql  i have a sql query i am running. what i was wanting to know is that is there a way of selecting the rows in a table where the value in on one of those columns is distinct  when i use the distinct function  it returns all of the distinct rows so...   <pre><code>select distinct teacher from class etc. </code></pre>   this works fine  but i am selecting multiple columns  so...   <pre><code>select distinct teacher  student etc. </code></pre>   but i don t want to retrieve the distinct rows  i want the distinct rows where the teacher is distinct. so this query would probably return the same teacher s name multiple times because the student value is different but what i would like is to return rows where the teachers are distinct  even if it means returning the teacher and one student name (because i don t need all the students).    i hope what i am trying to ask is clear but is it possible to use the distinct function on a single column even when selecting multiple columns or is there any other solution to this problem  thanks.   <hr>   the above is just an example i am giving. i don t know if using  distinct  is the solution to my problem. i am not using teacher etc. that was just an example to get the idea accross. i am selecting multiple columns (about 10) from different tables. i have a query to get the tabled result i want. now i want to query that table to find the unique values in one particular column. so using the teacher example again  say i have wrote a query and i have all the teachers and all the pupils they teach. now i want to go through each row in this table and email the teacher a message. but i don t want to email the teacher numerous times  just the once  so i want to return all the columns from the table i have  where only the teacher value is distinct.    col a   col b   col c   col d    a        b        c      d    a        c        d      b    b        a        a      c    b        c        c      c    a query i have produces the above table. now i want only those rows where col a values are unique. how would i go about it,sql

php why the difference when using http before $server variables   i ve googled and googled and am stumped.     i am trying to capture the url of a page after logging into the proxy    url of page before proxy login:   <pre><code>https://example.org/mypage.php </code></pre>   url of page after proxy login:   <pre><code>https ://example-org.proxy.example.org/mypage.php </code></pre>   when i try to capture the url using   <pre><code>$lnk =  https ://$_server[ http_host ]$_server[ request_uri ] ; </code></pre>   the output is as desired:    <pre><code>https ://example-org.proxy.example.org/mypage.php </code></pre>   when i leave off the https:// and just capture the $server variables the output lacks the proxy part of the url.     <pre><code>$lnk = $_server[ http_host ].$_server[ request_uri ]; </code></pre>   output:    <pre><code>example.org/mypage.php </code></pre>   the latter makes sense as if i dump the $server array i see that the the proxy part of the url missing.  how is it finding the proxy info in the first example     update:<br> i ve used an incogneto window in chrome and tried it on ie  same behavior. i tried the following<br> $lnk = $_server[ http_host ].$_server[ request_uri ];<br> $lnk2 =  https:// .$lnk;      echoing out both variables give the same results as above.  if i change the http:// to  bla  or  bla://  $lnk and $lnk2 both show the expected non proxied url.  it appears that http:// and https:// are changing this somehow and for the life of me i can t figure out how.,php

iphone internet connectivity  i m developing a game for the iphone at the moment and i d like to offer the player the option to submit their high scores to my server. the gameplay itself does not require internet connectivity.    what s the best way to handle this  just make the request and fail gracefully if there s no internet connection  or is there an api to request that the user connects to the internet     i m using nsurlrequest and nsurlconnection to submit the data.    i ve searched the apple docs and the only thing i ve come across is the flag for the persistent wifi connection but that seems like overkill.    any help is appreciated.,iphone

images and <div> pulled from rails model  when i view the source code for a site such as www.dribble.com i see that each image has it s own <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>  however when i pull images from my rails models with code such as:    <pre><code>&lt;div class= article &gt;  &lt;% @articles.in_groups_of(5  false).each do |group| %&gt;   &lt;div class= row &gt;    &lt;% group.each do |article| %&gt;     &lt;div class= col-md-2 &gt;        &lt;%= link_to image_tag(article.artwork.thumb)     %&gt;        &lt;%= sanitize(article.title) %&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;% end %&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;%= will_paginate @articles %&gt; </code></pre>   the images come as a single <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. instagram source code also shows that a user s 9 photos in their home page is single <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and instagram and their photo layout looks very similar to images plucked from a rails model.     does this mean that it is not possible to pull images from a rails model and make them fancy/responsive the way you see on www.dribble.com       also  do the other languages that allow you to make your photos responsive/fancy also provide you with the ability to pull images from models or does a site like www.dribble.com have to manually code each <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>/image  i ask because in every beginner s tutorial i see for java/html they are hand writing imgs into the code  i haven t seen any examples that are pulling images from models/databases the way they do in the rails tutorials.     as a bonus  in the above code i am trying to figure out two things:   <ol> <li> <code>rb.6</code> how to create a link to the id of the article   example.com/article/1  </li> <li> <code>rb.6</code> how to create a link to the url attached in the :title column. the title is entered into my form under the title column as <code>&lt;a href= http://cnn.com &gt;foo bar&lt;/a&gt;</code> and then sanitized in <code>rb.7</code> to  foo bar . </li> </ol>   thank you.,ruby-on-rails

what ios sdk fingerprinting features are unique per device   there is a lot of interest in digital  fingerprinting  for mobile devices.  given some recent moves from apple: <a href= http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/07/openidfa-a-solution-to-idfa-related-app-store-rejections-debuts/  rel= noreferrer >http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/07/openidfa-a-solution-to-idfa-related-app-store-rejections-debuts/</a> there is some increased interest.    one can do this by combining features that make the device somewhat unique.  this fingerprint does not need to be totally unique or 100% stable  just unique and stable enough to match a click to an app launch within a small period (say 1 week).      here is a closed source version:  <a href= https://github.com/ylechelle/openidfa  rel= noreferrer >https://github.com/ylechelle/openidfa</a>    and an open source one (from me): <a href= https://github.com/mcorner/actuallyopenidfa/  rel= noreferrer >https://github.com/mcorner/actuallyopenidfa/</a>    there are a number of features used here: <a href= https://github.com/mcorner/actuallyopenidfa/blob/master/aoi/aoi.m  rel= noreferrer >https://github.com/mcorner/actuallyopenidfa/blob/master/aoi/aoi.m</a>    some obvious features are not usable without user permission (location  contacts) and therefore can t be used with advertising.  others are not usable across apps (like the vendorid)  thus aren t usable from connecting a click in one app to a launch of another.  others are not particularly stable (like  ip).    what other features of ios might be useable,ios
two most recent rows for each id  i have the following query which is executed for a single user:   <pre><code>select b1.id  b1.id_type  b1.id_team  extra_bets_types.description  teams.conference  teams.division from extra_bets b1 inner join teams on b1.id_team = teams.id inner join extra_bets_types on b1.id_type = extra_bets_types.id where b1.id_user =   and b1.id_season = 6 and b1.id_type = 13 order by b1.timestamp desc limit 2 </code></pre>   it retrieves the 2 most recent rows from the table extra_bets for this specific user.    now i need a similar query that retrieves this information for each id_user in a table called users_season.    i ve tried using limit 2 in a sub query (select or inner join) but apparently this is not supported by mysql.    i m not that experienced in mysql queries and kind of don t know what else to try here. what you suggest     thanks!,mysql

java cash register: getting change from in different subunits  teaching myself java  i reached an example problem that asks me to create a cash register program that will calculate the total change back to the customer in dollars  nickels  quarters  dimes  and pennies.    i worked out the user input but getting the correct sub-units is tricky part. for example: it s was easy to write the line of code that returned $1 dollar back if the cost was $4 and amount tendered was $5. but the trouble i am having is putting how many dimes and pennies needed in the correct field.  ex2: total cost $4.62  tendered: $5  change: $0.38   <pre><code>            system.out.print( enter the sale amount: $    );     double sale = user.nextdouble();     system.out.print( enter the amount tendered by customer: $    );     double tendered = user.nextdouble();     double totalchange = (tendered - sale);     system.out.printf( total change: $  %.2f\n   totalchange);     dollars = totalchange/1;     quarters = totalchange/25;     dimes = totalchange/10;     nickels = totalchange/5;     pennies = totalchange/1;         system.out.printf( dollars: %.2f\n   dollars);     system.out.printf( quarters: %.2f\n   quarters);     system.out.printf( dimes: %.2f\n   dimes);     system.out.printf( nickels: %.2f\n   nickels);     system.out.printf( pennies: %.2f\n   pennies); </code></pre>   i don t need the answer (because i want to learn and teach myself)  but just need some advice on how to go about doing so.    edit: what am i doing wrong with this algorithm:   <pre><code>            dollars = totalchange/1;     dollars = (int)dollars;     dl = totalchange % 1;      quarters = dl/0.25;     q = quarters % 0.25;     quarters = (int)quarters;      dimes = q / .10;     d = dimes % .10;        nickels = d / .5;     n = nickels % .5;      pennies = n / .1;     n = pennies/ .1; </code></pre>,java

applying a max-width larger than 100%  so  i have a list of <code>inline-block</code> list items. they all vary in width  but are always on the same line. the number of list items may also vary  so i can not predict the width of the list as a whole. the list should always be centered in its parent container  but when the width exceeds 100%  it should gain a horizontal scroll rather than extending over two lines.    now  as far as i understand  if i set the <code>width</code> to <code>auto</code>  it is actually set to <code>shrink-to-fit</code> – essentially meaning <code>max-width: 100%;</code>  which is not what i want.    is there a way for me to achieve this reliably with css alone     <strong>markup</strong>   <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;   &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;banana&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;krypton&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;molten boron&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   <strong>css</strong>   <pre><code>div {   overflow-x: auto;   width: 500px; } ul {    max-width: 5000px; /* doesn t override */    width: auto; /* calculated to 500px or less */ } li { display: inline-block; } </code></pre>   it should be noted that this is a responsive layout  so the width of the container is not exactly fixed  but i m not afraid of manual labour.    my js fiddle: <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/thenix/gdrab/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://jsfiddle.net/thenix/gdrab/</a>    my question is similar to <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6042327/css-dynamic-width-larger-than-100 >css dynamic width larger than 100%</a> except my child elements are not floated  ergo still in the flow (i have control over this).    regarding <code>width: auto;</code> in the spec: <a href= http://www.w3.org/tr/css2/visudet.html#inline-replaced-width  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://www.w3.org/tr/css2/visudet.html#inline-replaced-width</a>,css
how can i delete rows with a few identical values in mysql   i have a table with about 11 fields (columns)  and i know for a fact that there are multiple repeating entries  but they are repeating only within few fields. what i want to do is that if two or more rows have identical <code>providername</code> and <code>address</code> in lowercase  and identical <code>stateid</code>  then i want to delete those extra rows  and leave just one copy of it. i have something like this  but i have no idea how to complete it.   <pre><code>set sql_safe_updates=0; delete from providers where lcase(providername)  lcase(address)  stateid; </code></pre>   <strong>update:</strong>   <pre><code>set sql_safe_updates=0; delete p1.*  from providers as p1 join providers as p2  on lcase(p1.providername) = lcase(p2.providername) and lcase(p1.address) = lcase(p2.address) and p1.zip = p2.zip and p1.stateid = p2.stateid and p1.providerid &gt; p2.providerid </code></pre>,mysql

android: how to create multiply views screen   i want to create an activity  which shows a question with 4 answers  and at the bottom of the screen i want to place a timer.    i have already found timer example  and i created a question with the answers. the problem that they are 2 different projects and activities  and i am looking for the best way to implement it. i think i can t show 2 activities on one screen  but i can show 2 views or shell i use the viewgroup  or maybe to copy-paste one of the activities code to another ( its the easiest way but probably the most ugliest way to implement it). please tell me what is the best way  that i will study and not to waste time to study all the ways and only then to choose one of them.,android

c# at first button click my program doesn t fill all array elements  why   i ve created a  random password generator  app (i m a beginner  just for practicing) and somehow at first button click it only fills 5-6-7 elements of my array.     this code might be strange (for generating random characters)  i just looked ascii table and searched for numbers  letters and i ve put them into random min and max number.    <pre><code> string[] ch = new string [11];  random r = new random();   private void button1_click(object sender  eventargs e)  {     for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 9; i++)     {         if (convert.toint64(r.next()) % 3 == 0)             ch[i] = convert.tostring(convert.tochar(r.next(49  57)));          else if (convert.toint64(r.next()) % 3 == 1)              ch[i] = convert.tostring(convert.tochar(r.next(65  89)));          else if (convert.toint64(r.next()) % 3 == 2)              ch[i] = convert.tostring(convert.tochar(r.next(97  122)));      }      pass.text = (convert.tostring(ch[0] +    + ch[1] +    + ch[2] +    + ch[3] +    + ch[4] +    + ch[5] +    + ch[6] +    + ch[7] +    + ch[8] +    + ch[9]));    </code></pre>   to decide to use number (ascii 49-57) small letters (65-89) or bigs (97-122) i just made a random number then (truncating divided ) divided by 3 and result is then 0 1 or 2 then made ifs for them.     might be stupid but its my own idea. so when i click on the button  at first time it shows only about 5 6 7 elements of arrays. anybody knows why,c#

.net: non-ui-specific image class  as far as i know in winforms one uses the <code>image</code> class from the <code>system.drawing</code> namespace and in wpf one uses the <code>image</code> class from the <code>system.windows.controls</code> namespace.    what class would you recommend to use in a library that should be usable from both sides  winforms and wpf  is there a non-ui-specific image class that can be used to give image information back from the library to winforms or wpf code  that can be converted to the proper image class on the receiving end     in case it s needed for a proper answer. mp3 files can contain image information in their tags. if i wanted to create a library that reads out these tags  what format or object should i present these image information to the ui layer     thanks for your help.,.net

why doesn t my function have scope of the javascript variables   i m trying to get my head around something re scope/closures.    i ve setup an index.html with an app.js pulled in via <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>    the functions are accessible in things like <code>&lt;button onclick= increment();&gt; ...</code>    <strong>index.html</strong>   <pre><code>&lt;body&gt;     &lt;script src= app.js  type= text/javascript &gt;&lt;/script&gt;     &lt;button onclick= increment(); &gt;&lt;/button&gt;      &lt;h2 id= number &gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/body&gt; </code></pre>   <strong>app.js</strong>   <pre><code>let total = 0;  function increment() {     total += 1;     document.getelementbyid( number ).innerhtml = total; }  settimeout(() =&gt; {   console.log( total is:    total); }  5000) </code></pre>   so scenario a above has a function that when called in html  increments the <code>let total...</code> fine. then it posts it in the h2 tag/html. this works fine. and the timeout is there to test that 5 seconds later  it is indeed the <code>let total...</code> variable that s been incremented (i wondered before if i was creating a global variable within the function).    scenario b calls a function (<code>startgame()</code> which <em>itself</em> calls the increment function with total passed in) but this <em>doesn t</em> work. why would it lose scope of total      <strong>app.js</strong>   <pre><code>    let total = 0;  function startgame() {     console.log( game has started );     increment(total);     console.log( game has finished ); } function increment(tot) {     tot += 1;     document.getelementbyid( number ).innerhtml = tot; }  settimeout(() =&gt; {   console.log( total is:    total); }  5000) </code></pre>,javascript

hide text after script load  how do i move spritz box to the top of page when it loads  or  how do i remove all text from the page after spritz gets the text  and  how can i make it so that anyone who visits the page can upload a .txt file for spritz to read     i m trying to code a very simple web page in html  but i m having some problems.    the end result of what i m trying to do is that when my page finishes loading  nothing shows up except for the spritz box (see code below) which i want to start showing the words from the book (again  see code below).    the problems i am having is that the text is taking up too much space on the page (were talking about a couple hundred thousand words here  i removed a bunch for sake of this question). this causes problems with the area that spritz shows up in (usually at the bottom of the massive page of text).   <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt; &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div id= bodycontent  class= mw-body-content &gt; &lt;font size= 0 &gt;                         the magicians - lev grossman book i brooklyn quentin did a magic trick. nobody noticed. they picked their way along the cold  uneven sidewalk together: james  julia  and quentin. james and julia held hands. that’s how things were now. the sidewalk wasn’t quite wide enough  so quentin trailed after them  like a sulky child. he would rather have been alone with julia  or just alone period  but you couldn’t have everything. or at least the available evidence pointed overwhelmingly to that conclusion. “okay!” james said over his shoulder. “q. let’s talk strategy.” james seemed to have a sixth sense for when quentin was starting to feel sorry for himself. quentin’s interview was in seven minutes. james was right after him. “nice firm handshake. lots of eye contact. then when he’s feeling comfortable  you hit him with a chair and i’ll break his password and e-mail princeton.” “just be yourself  q ” julia said. her dark hair was pulled back in a wavy bunch. somehow it made it worse that she was always so nice to him. “how is that different from what i said ” quentin did the magic trick again. it was a very small trick  a basic one-handed sleight with a nickel. he did it in his coat pocket where nobody could see. he did it again  then he did it backward. “i have one guess for his password ” james said. “password.” it was kind of incredible how long this had been going on  quentin thought. they were only seventeen  but he felt like he’d known james and julia forever. the school systems in brooklyn sorted out the gifted ones and shoved them together  then separated the ridiculously brilliant ones from the merely gifted ones and shoved them together  and as a result they’d been bumping into each other in the same speaking contests and regional latin exams and tiny  specially convened ultra-advanced math classes since elementary school. the nerdiest of the nerds. by now  their senior year  quentin knew james and julia better than he knew anybody else in the world  not excluding his parents  and they knew him. everybody knew what everybody else was going to say before they said it. everybody who was going to sleep with anybody else had already done it. julia—pale  freckled  dreamy julia  who played the oboe and knew even more physics than he did—was never going to sleep with quentin. quentin was thin and tall  though he habitually hunched his shoulders in a vain attempt to brace himself against whatever blow was coming from the heavens  and which would logically hit the tall people first. his shoulder-length hair was freezing in clumps. he should have stuck around to dry it after gym  especially with his interview today  but for some reason—maybe he was in a self-sabotaging mood—he hadn’t. the low gray sky threatened snow. it seemed to quentin like the world was offering up special little tableaux of misery just for him: crows perched on power lines  stepped-in dog shit  windblown trash  the corpses of innumerable wet oak leaves being desecrated in innumerable ways by innumerable vehicles and pedestrians. “god  i’m full ” james said. “i ate too much. why do i always eat too much ” &lt;/font&gt;

recycleurls:completionhandler: with nil makes it block until completion   i was sending a file to the trash with   <pre><code>[nsworkspace recycleurls: myarrayofonensurl              completionhandler: nil] </code></pre>   <code>myarrayofonensurl</code> is a <code>nsarray</code> created with <code>arraywithobject:</code> of a single <code>nsurl</code> that was created for an absolute file path with <code>fileurlwithpath:isdirectory:</code>.    the normal way to tell if it is successful is to use the <code>completionhandler</code> and then check if the 2nd arg (<code>nserror</code>) is <code>nil</code>  which means success.    is there anyway to check success without this callback  currently i have setup a loop after calling this  to check for file existence  if 1second has past and it still exists  i declare fail. i was wondering if i set <code>nil</code> as second arg to <code>recycleurls:completionhandler:</code> does it make it block until the process completes (regardless of success)  in my tests  the very first check always finds that the file is no longer at its original place (meaning it was trashed)  but i m not sure if my computer is just super fast  or it really is blocking until file operation completes.,objective-c
difference between creating java string with and without new operator  with new operator string create the string in heap and put a copy in string const pool so the result of hashcode is same in below case;   <pre><code>  string s1 = new string( test );    string s2 = new string( test );    system.out.println(s1.hashcode() +    + s2.hashcode() +     + s1.equals(s2)); </code></pre>   but without using new operator its still giving the same hashcode    <pre><code>string s1 = new string( test );     string s2 =  test ;     system.out.println(s1.hashcode() +    + s2.hashcode() +     + s1.equals(s2)); </code></pre>   then what is the differnce between above two notation of string creation although  they are referening to same string in string const. pool,java

how to properly execute performfetchwithcompletionhandler with multiple blocks inside  i m using the background fetch method <code>performfetchwithcompletionhandler</code> in order to update some user data. however  those processes are fairly complicated and include block statements  so they don t execute synchronously.     my concern is that i am always returning <code>completionhandler(uibackgroundfetchresultnewdata);</code>   <pre><code>-(void)application:(uiapplication *)application performfetchwithcompletionhandler:(void (^)(uibackgroundfetchresult))completionhandler {     nslog(@ start background data fetch );      // update data -- this method contains various blocks inside     [getdatarequest updateuserdatawithuser: user];      // update images -- this method contains various blocks inside     [getimagesrequest updateuserimageswithuser: user];      nslog(@ background data fetch completed );     completionhandler(uibackgroundfetchresultnewdata); } </code></pre>   according to <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19414317/when-to-call-completionhandler-in-applicationperformfetchwithcompletionhandler >this post</a>  in regards to <code>completionhandler(uibackgroundfetchresultnewdata)</code> the following was mentioned:    <blockquote>    you have to call this to let ios know what the result of your background fetch was. it uses this information to schedule future background fetches. if you neglect to do this  future background fetches may be delayed by the os. the consequences of not calling this handler might include terminating your app altogether.  </blockquote>   as you can see here  i am always saying it s successful whether or not it actually is. the answerer had this to say about my situation:   <blockquote>    ...you should call the completion handler only when your fetch is actually complete. otherwise ios will probably put your application back to sleep before the connection completes  and apps shouldn t actually be able to determine uibackgroundfetchresultnewdata versus uibackgroundfetchresultnodata or uibackgroundfetchresultfailed until then anyway. how do you know your connection will succeed   </blockquote>   is what i m doing actually a problem  will it actually cut off the updates  if it is going to produce unexpected results  what s the solution to this mess  the answer to the question i mentioned wasn t clear enough to me. i have tried using block variables to make it function as it should  but have been unsuccessful. much appreciated.,objective-c

jquery callback html and json  i have some jquery which passes variables to a php file  the php file generates dynamic html content based on these variables to be passed back which i then use for updating the page.     however i also want to return some variables also so i can then decide how and where to display the html content.    the only way i have found so far seems a little crude and i m sure a better way exists.    at the moment the php file puts the generated content in a tag like so   <pre><code>&lt;content&gt;content here&lt;/content&gt; </code></pre>   then i use another tag for the var s i also want to return.   <pre><code>&lt;json&gt;{ name  :  value }&lt;/json&gt; </code></pre>   then i have this on the ajax callback   <pre><code>content = $(data).find( content ).html(); json = $(data).find( json ).text(); </code></pre>,jquery

does android support lock-down to a fully replaced interface   <strong>what for </strong> this question is about how to take a peice of android hardware and os and turn it into an interface. it would be our own hardware  never leave the building  and run any program we create. <strong>why </strong> the android has built in battery backup  theft detection (gps)  and an elegant touch screen  and a familiar programming interface.    <strong>what i want:</strong>   <ol> <li> can i require that no matter what is pressed on the screen  the user never leaves my app     are there <strong>instructions</strong> to do this  is it <strong>officially supported</strong>  <strong>or would i have to start hacking away</strong>  (using a system-level interface  removing voice activation (when a user holds down the search button)  disable auto updates  etc)    ideally  i want to just write a single app that replaces the whole interface  and i want a way to hook the app in  without a bunch of extra work (rooting the phone and manually removing certain built-in apps). </li> <li> i would also want to lock the usb into a  charge-only  mode  to prevent mounting of the file system without my app s approval. i am not concerned about a really determined guy who opens up the device and mounts the internal storage unit s filesystem. </li> <li> in the event of a crash  i would like to have a second app that decides whether or not to restart the first app. </li> </ol>   obviously  i don t want the phone to become unusable  even if it is just spare hardware.,android

prevent css conflicts in webapps  i am building a webapp which others may embed on their website. a part of this webapp constructs dialogues  which have their own stylesheets. a problem may occur if  for example  my dialogue container is in a class <code>.container</code>  while the website the app is embedded on also uses a <code>.container</code> for some other means.    i have considered renaming all my classes like <code>.appname-container</code>  and will do that if there is no other solution. however  i would like to be as lazy as possible. is there any easier way to prevent unforeseen conflicts with stylesheets i have no control of     <strong>edit</strong>: my webapp wraps itself around a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element  so i m not sure that <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s can be used.,css

is doubling the capacity of a dynamic array necessary   when making automatically expanding arrays (like c++ s std::vector) in c  it is often common (or at least common advice) to double the size of the array each time it is filled to limit the amount of calls to <code>realloc</code> in order to avoid copying the entire array as much as possible.    eg. we start by allocating room for 8 elements  8 elements are inserted  we then allocate room for 16 elements  8 more elements are inserted  we allocate for 32..  etc.    but <code>realloc</code> does not have to actually copy the data if it can expand the existing memory allocation. for example  the following code only does 1 copy (the initial null allocation  so it is not really a copy) on my system  even though it calls <code>realloc</code> 10000 times:   <pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  int main() {     int i;     int copies = 0;     void *data = null;     void *ndata;      for (i = 0; i &lt; 10000; i++)     {         ndata = realloc(data  i * sizeof(int));         if (data != ndata)             copies++;         data = ndata;     }     printf( %d\n   copies);  } </code></pre>   i realize that this example is very clinical - a real world application would probably have more memory fragmentation and would do more copies  but even if i make a bunch of random allocations before the <code>realloc</code> loop  it only does marginally worse with 2-4 copies instead.    so  is the  doubling method  really necessary  would it not be better to just call <code>realloc</code> each time a element is added to the dynamic array,c

simple mysql query returns multiple rows  i have the following table structure for my users and friends table.    <pre><code>users: first_name  last_name  friends: to_id  from_id  friend_status </code></pre>   so if users <code>4 and 7</code> are friends  i store them in the friend s table as <code>4 | 7 | 1</code> or <code>7 | 4 | 1</code> depending on who initiated the friendship. i do not do duplicate entries so 4 | 7 | 1 and 7 | 4 | 1 are not stored. only one will be stored.    my problem is when i want to do a simple search for a friend whose name is paul. each of the following snippets below work fine by themselves but together  i get multiple rows that show inacurrate users who are not even friends.    <pre><code>select u.* from `users` u  `friends` f where concat(u.first_name     u.last_name)  like  %paul%   and ((f.to_id=$logged_in_uid or f.from_id=$logged_in_uid)  and f.friend_status=1); </code></pre>   again  the above doesn t even return the friends  but the latter portion alone does bring back friends when used by itself.    thanks and any help is truly appreciated :),mysql

separated string into specific temp table colums  i am using a <code>right(left())</code> method of stripping a string as each character needs to be put into its own holder so i can access it and use it for a report (each character needs to be in its own box for some reason).    there are 16 characters usually but for space and to save repition i ve slimmed down the code.    what i am trying to do is put the separated character value into the corresponding column of the temp table - how is this best achieved     i have no other use for this data once used i ll destroy it.    <strong>code</strong>   <pre><code>create table #stringseparate ( col1 varchar(1)  col2 varchar(1)  col3 varchar(1)  col4 varchar(1)  col5 varchar(1)  col6 varchar(1)  col7 varchar(1)  col8 varchar(1)  )  declare @string varchar(16) set @string =  tpg22052015-1204   select left(@string 1)  right(left(@string 2) 1)  right(left(@string 3) 1)  right(left(@string 4) 1)  right(left(@string 5) 1)  right(left(@string 6) 1)  right(left(@string 7) 1)  right(left(@string 8) 1) into #string separate </code></pre>,sql

launching a program from a server on an intranet  okay  so i know you don t normally want people to be able to execute programs from a server  but that s what i d like to do. i ve got it to the point where i can execute the program if it is installed on the local computer while i am running from the local client machine (using vs 2010). if i try to run it from the server  i get a  system cannot find file  error. here is the code that i can get to run if running from the local client machine:   <pre><code>protected sub begintutorial(sender as object  e as system.eventargs) handles button1.click     dim psi as new processstartinfo()     psi.filename =  c:\program files\savvy training tutorials\word 2010\savvy s word 2010 tutorial menu.exe      psi.workingdirectory = io.path.getdirectoryname(psi.filename)     diagnostics.process.start(psi) end sub </code></pre>   i ve also got the program installed on the server  so if i change the file path  it gives me the above mentioned  cannot find file  error. i ve tried installing the file either to the default location on the server  or also within the directory containing the website. below are the two examples:    default install:   <pre><code>protected sub begintutorial(sender as object  e as system.eventargs) handles button1.click     dim psi as new processstartinfo()     psi.filename =  c:\program files\savvy training tutorials\word 2010\savvy s word 2010 tutorial menu.exe      psi.workingdirectory = io.path.getdirectoryname(psi.filename)     diagnostics.process.start(psi) end sub </code></pre>   install to directory containing website:   <pre><code>protected sub begintutorial(sender as object  e as system.eventargs) handles button1.click     dim psi as new processstartinfo()     psi.filename =  e:\intranet\word 2010\savvy s word 2010 tutorial menu.exe      psi.workingdirectory = io.path.getdirectoryname(psi.filename)     diagnostics.process.start(psi) end sub </code></pre>   i ve also tried taking out the apostrophe and that didn t work either. any thoughts,asp.net

bindinglist equivalent in silverlight  want to observe changes in collection elements  i was looking around for something like <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms668604.aspx  rel= nofollow ><code>observablecollection&lt;t&gt;</code></a> that would also raise an event whenever the properties of item in the collection change.  i came across <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132679.aspx  rel= nofollow ><code>bindinglist&lt;t&gt;</code></a>  but was disappointed to learn that it s not available in silverlight.    i m aware that i could build this fairly easily by subclassing <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms668604.aspx  rel= nofollow ><code>observablecollection&lt;t&gt;</code></a> and subscribing to the propertychanged events of items as they are added (and unsubscribing as they are removed  of course).  before i do that  though  i want to make sure there isn t something i can use out of the box.,c#

implementing non blocking request in php. howto  the problem i face now is that i do not know how to implement non-blocking requests in php. in my application any user activity is archived and this archiving process may take some significant time - up to 5-10 seconds. because of this user interface (which is in javascript) is no longer responsive since it also depends on requests to server. so  suppose i made a request to the server like this (using <code>extjs</code> library which does not matter here):   <pre><code>  ext.ajax.request({       url: /handlers/archive.php   // my handler which i want to make non-blocking       method: post         params:{...} // some parameters submitted to the server   });   ... here are other multiple request to the server    ... they are now waiting for the completion of heavy archive.php procedure </code></pre>   so  how to make this php procedure truly non-blocking  any working example of a non-blocking procedure will be extremely helpful.,php

catch file.exists() securityexception java  i m fairly new to java and after some searching about catching the securityexception for file.exists() i don t see people catching it so i m unsure if i should catch the exception or not. eclipse doesn t complain either way. this is a server expansion plugin and i wont have control when others run it. here s the code for the class:   <pre><code>public class chatchannels {     private javaplugin plugin;     private hashset&lt;chatchannel&gt; chatchannels;     private static chatchannels instance;     file configfile;     fileconfiguration config;      private chatchannels(javaplugin plugin) {         this.plugin = plugin;         configfile = new file(plugin.getdatafolder().getpath()                 .concat(file.separator).concat( data )   channels.yml );         chatchannels = new hashset&lt;chatchannel&gt;();         config = yamlconfiguration.loadconfiguration(configfile);          if (!configfile.exists()) {             return;         }          for (string channelname : config.getstringlist( channels )) {             chatchannels.add(new chatchannel(channelname));         }     }      public static chatchannels getinstance(javaplugin plugin) {         if (instance == null) {             instance = new chatchannels(plugin);         }         return instance;     } } </code></pre>   so  should i catch the exception or is it unnecessary    <pre><code>try {     if (!configfile.exists()) {         return;     } }  catch (securityexception e) {     plugin.getlogger().log(level.severe  configfile.getpath().concat(  read permission denied. )  e); } </code></pre>,java

adding jar in classpath using regexp  i have a question around addition of specific jars from a specific folder.    scenario: i have a lib folder which contains a number of jar files. due to some issue  i have to give preference to a jar file over others.    refer this issue: <a href= http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi id=327  rel= nofollow >http://bugzilla.slf4j.org/show_bug.cgi id=327</a>    now am trying to put a specific jar file to be loaded first here log4j-1.2.17.jar    one option is i simply hardcode this in my app script to make sure this jar is always added firstly in the classpath.    <strong>problem in the approach:</strong> since the project is maven based  there is a chance that log4j version changes. and in that cases i am prone to same issue again  as i have to go and change the version in the script too.    other option (for which i am searching the solution)  there is some possibility like:     example command (<strong>expected  but this is not working though</strong>):    <pre><code>java -cp &lt;path to my app&gt;/lib/log4j*:&lt;path to my app&gt;/lib/* mainclass </code></pre>   the advantage i see here  even if log4j version changes  i will not have to change the script.    need inputs how can i achieve approach 2     thanks,java

naming properties different than their instance var   i m new to objective-c 2.0 (coming from .net c#) and i discovered the properties. they are very handy for dealing with the memory management (retain).    so i can set the vars in the init method pretty easy like   <pre><code>@property (retain) nsdate *d1  *d2; </code></pre>   and   <pre><code>@synthesize d1  d2;  -(id)init {     if (self = [super init]) {         // initialize properties         self.d1 = [nsdate date];         self.d2 = [nsdate date];     }             return self; } </code></pre>   sometimes i forget (may be because of my .net background) to use the  self.  it looks familiar and not really like bad coding. so i might miss it in the future again...   <pre><code>-(id)init {     if (self = [super init]) {         // initialize properties         d1 = [nsdate date];         d2 = [nsdate date];     }             return self; } </code></pre>   but this will result in an exc_bad_access violation when the property will be set using <code>self.d1 = [nsdate date];</code> or from outside <code>objxy.d1 = [nsdate date];</code>    i would appreciate it  when the compiler will warn me about using properties directly and not through the synthesized messages. this could be done easily by naming the instance var different then the property.    just wondering  if anybody is doing this that way  or in another...  my researches showed  that it is possible  but i need to declare the vars on my own in the header file. for this i would use a prefix (the _ is reserved for the cf) so i would need something bigger like xy_ ... hm... not really so handy...    why not having an attribute for properties like (unique) which will generate a instance var with an different name than the property name... @apple,objective-c

c++ arithmetic operator without new return object  this is a rather simple concept. i have an arithmetic operator and i wish for the operation to <em>update</em> not <em>create</em> an object. essentially    <pre><code>mytype a; mytype b; mytype c;  a = b - c; a = c - b; </code></pre>   the statement <code>a = b - c</code> should not call the constructor for mytype again since a is already created  i.e. the constructor should only be called 3 times in this program. is there some way to achieve this while maintaining a nice syntax  i suspect that i could let the operator function know not to create an object but rather to use some reference. is there a more streamlined way to do this using some c++ syntax unknown to me    <pre><code>class mytype {     mytype* operatorreturnobj;      mytype operator-(const mytype&amp; left  const mytype&amp; right)     {         // this removed and replaced with setoperatorreturnobj function         // mytype operatorreturnobj();          operatorreturnobj= left - right;         return operatorreturnobj;     }       void mytype setoperatorreturnobj(mytype* ref)     {          operatorreturnobj = ref;     } }; </code></pre>,c++

how to clear individual file inputs   below is part of the jquery code i have which displays the file input and a  clear file  button.   <pre><code>var $imagefile = $( &lt;input /&gt; )     .attr({         type:  file           name:  imagefile           class:  imagefile      });  $image.append($imagefile);  var $imageclear = $( &lt;input /&gt; )     .attr({         type:  button           name:  imageclear           class:  imageclear           value:  clear file      });  $( .imageclear ).click(function(event){   event.preventdefault();   $( .imagefile ).replacewith( &lt;input type= file  class= imagefile  /&gt; ); }); </code></pre>   now if you look at the bottom of the jquery code  it shows a function i am using where if the user clicks on the  clear file  button  it replaces the file input so that if you have chose a file but then want to clear the input  then it does this by replacing the input.    the problem though is that lets say i have two  imagefile  inputs (each file input contains its own  clear file  button  and they both contain a file  then lets say i want to clear the first file input only  when i click on the  clear file  button  it clears both file inputs  even though i only want it to clear one file input. so how do i code it so that each  clear file  button only clears the file input it belongs to,jquery

remove number forever from an array  i have a fixed set of numbers in nsarray. example: i have 10 numbers: 1  20  31  33  54 66  77 87 90 99. (these are basically unique serial numbers)    when someone types a number  i want to validate if its one of those numbers and remove it from the list forever. as in  suppose i type 20  it should say  valid  and 20 should be removed. if i type 20 again  it should say   invalid number . i have been able to validate and remove them. however  how do i remove them forever  by  forever   i mean  if 2 people have my app on their phones  and phone1 has already used the code 20  then for phone2  it should say code is invalid.    is there a way i can do this  probably by connecting to the internet,ios

extending default ios phone number/address detection actions  when you have a text area in ios  it has the capability to detect phone numbers  urls  and street addresses.  when you touch and hold on the linked item  it will pop up actions.    for example  when you see a phone number such as 303-338-2929 and tap and hold the link you will see the following options:    call  text message  create new contact  add to existing contact.      is there any way to extend these default actions for my own app   for example  web search.    thanks for any ideas....,ios

how to restrict multiple login in same browser  in my project  there are four logins: admin  teacher  student and parent  and four master pages respectively. in logintable  typeid is stored as 1-student 2-teacher 3-parent 4-admin.    during login  i am checking the type and according to typeid  i lead to corresponding master page.    my problem is that  when i login as admin  it leads to admin master page. when i take another tab and in login page  i am able to login as another user. i don t want to take multiple logins in same browser. how can i restrict this     eg: when i login as teacher  teacher master page is opened and take next tab and when i login as student  it should not to be allowed    my code for login   <pre><code>int type = dallogin.logingettype(login1.username); if (type == 1) { response.redirect( student.aspx ); } else if (type == 2) { response.redirect( teacher.aspx ); } else if (type == 3) { response.redirect( parent.aspx ); }  else if (type == 4) { response.redirect( admin.aspx ); } </code></pre>,asp.net
is there a good way to automate translation of objects between different architectural layers   more and more applications need different representations of similar objects  e.g.  when crossing the wire with web services or when mapping to the database. when you are working with a domain model you probably need one kind of objects in your business layer/domain model (small  lots of behaviour) and another when crossing process or network boundaries (big  only data) or when talking to the database (e.g.  linq to sql only supports 1-to-1 mapping between db tables and generated/mapped objects).    this means you have to write a lot of code performing the rote task of translating/mapping similar objects to eachother. surely there must be some kind of framework or tool to help you do this  or is manual coding the only way to really be in control  we have investigated using reflection and xml/attribute mapping to solve this ourselves but it quickly gets fairly complicated  e.g.  mapping subobjects and lists or several primitives on one object to a subobject on the other object.    we are using c# on .net 3.5.,.net

access local variable in function from module  i have a function in my main program that attempts to retrieve information from an imported module  which is a different script i wrote. this module spits out a variable which i access from the main program by making it a global.    however  since i m threading the function that requests the information  the global variable gets polluted by adding the information from separate requests into one var. what i m looking for is a way to access a local variable in a function in a module.    main program:   <pre><code>import module  def threaded_function():     module.function(var1  var2)     print module.output </code></pre>   module:   <pre><code>def function(var1  var2):     global output       output = []     dothingswithvars(var1  var2)     output.append(result) </code></pre>   since the threading causes it to get accessed multiple times i figured i d not use global variables and get the local variables for each request. any idea how i can get at those,python
moving the contents of a view rather than the view itself  i am creating my own slide menu which is pretty simple.    i am creating a subview  adding it to the view and then sliding the <code>self.view</code> to the right by <code>170px</code> which reveals the new subview (named <code>secondview</code>).    however  none of the buttons on the new view are clickable after moving the <code>self.view</code> to the right (as they were before i did this). so i image that because the view has moved  the view is the clickable region of the app.    is there a way to move the content across as opposed to the view to allow the new view to be clickable.,objective-c

mysql result not performing after query is run   hi i have two query s here that run as part of a registration form  upon the user registering information is split into two tables  ptb_users and ptb_stats.    both query s are working ok. however both tables have an auto increment column  in ptb_users the column user_id is set to auto increment  and at the end of the query the user_id value is set to update/copy into ptb_users.id so that the user_id and id match.     but in ptb_stats id is the auto increment column and again i have asked it to update/copy the value from id to user_id within the ptb_stats table.    i am doing this by using this code:   <pre><code>$result = mysql_query( update ptb_users set ptb_users.user_id=ptb_users.id );  $result2 = mysql_query( update ptb_users set ptb_stats.id=ptb_stats.user_id ); </code></pre>   now for some reason this works on the first query ($result) where i am asking it to update ptb_users.user_id=ptb_users.id but it doesnt work on ($result 2) is there any reason why this is the case    <pre><code>$query= insert into ptb_users (user_id  id  first_name  last_name  email ) values( null    null     .$firstname.      .$lastname.      .$email.   ) ; mysql_query($query) or dieerr(); $result = mysql_query( update ptb_users set ptb_users.user_id=ptb_users.id );   $query= insert into ptb_stats (id  user_id  display_name ) values( null    null     .$username.   ) ; mysql_query($query) or dieerr(); $result2 = mysql_query( update ptb_stats set ptb_stats.id=ptb_stats.user_id ); </code></pre>,mysql

what would be an effective way to call a function with arguments from a list in python  my current code is similar to the following.   <pre><code>    def func(args):         optionalparameters = ((args.split( : )[1]).split(   ))[1:]         second_func(optionalparameters) </code></pre>   this assumes <code>args</code> is a colon-separated string; it takes the second half  splits it into space-delimited words and returns (a list of ) all but the first. the situation where more than one colon is included isn t yet handled  because i am new to the language.    can the optional_parameters be passed not as a list  since parameters are optional will the following be effective    <pre><code>    def func(args):         optionalparameters = ((args.split( : )[1]).split(   ))[1:]         val1=val2=val3=none         try:             val1 = optionalparameters[0]         except indexerror:             pass         try:             val2 = optionalparameters[1]         except indexerror:             pass         try:                 val3 = optionalparameters[2]         except indexerror:             pass         second_func(val1  val2  val3) </code></pre>   it seems likely that standard library modules might be able to do much of this. any help in argument handling is highly appreciated.,python

angularjs ngdisabled isn t activated as it should be  i have a code that should disable a button when : <code>registerform.$invalid || form.password != form.passwordbis</code>  which should mean :  disable the button if the form isn t valid or if the  $scope.form.password  variable isn t equal to  $scope.form.passwordbis .   isn t it     so here i have a code that activate the button if the two passwords matches. which shouldn t happen  because the first condition is still wrong !    html :   <pre><code>&lt;div ng-app= app  ng-controller= formctrl &gt;     &lt;form name= registerform &gt;         &lt;div class= header &gt;             &lt;h2&gt;create your account&lt;/h2&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;div class= form-group &gt;             &lt;div class= title &gt;first name&lt;/div&gt;             &lt;input type= text  name= firstname  ng-required class= form-control  ng-class= {empty:form.firstname.length==0}  ng-model= form.firstname  required&gt;&lt;/input&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;div class= form-group &gt;             &lt;div class= title &gt;last name&lt;/div&gt;             &lt;input type= text  name= lastname  ng-required class= form-control  ng-class= {empty:form.lastname.length==0}  ng-model= form.lastname  required&gt;&lt;/input&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;div class= form-group &gt;             &lt;div class= title &gt;email&lt;/div&gt;             &lt;input type= email  name= email  ng-required class= form-control  ng-class= {empty:form.email.length==0}  ng-model= form.email  required&gt;&lt;/input&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;div class= form-group &gt;             &lt;div class= title &gt;password&lt;/div&gt;             &lt;input type= password  name= password  class= form-control  ng-class= {empty:form.password.length==0}  ng-model= form.password  required&gt;&lt;/input&gt;             &lt;input type= password  name= passwordbis  class= form-control  ng-class= {empty:form.passwordbis.length==0}  ng-model= form.passwordbis  minlength= 6  required&gt;&lt;/input&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;div ng-if= form.password != form.passwordbis  class= error &gt;passwords doesn t match.&lt;/div&gt;         &lt;div class= form-group &gt;             &lt;button class= btn btn-success  ng-click= register()  ng-disabled= registerform.$invalid || form.password != form.passwordbis &gt;register&lt;/button&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   js :   <pre><code>var app = angular.module( app   []);  app.controller( formctrl   function($scope) {     $scope.form = {             firstname:                 lastname:                 email:                 password:                 passwordbis:        }; }); </code></pre>   and you can test it : <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/smbw994a/3/  rel= nofollow ><strong>jsfiddle</strong></a>    what am i missing,angularjs
sending a string to a server  i m stuck couple of days with my app trying to figure out a way to program on the receiving android side.    basically  my app should send a string  from android device to another device and to do something with that string in the receiving android device.    so  i thought about sending this string from the android device to a server and that server will send that string to the other device ( assuming both devices have my app running in the background ) .     i dont have any idea how to program on the receiving side   i supposed its called client/server programming but im not sure.    i would be glad to hear some advices how to do this thing or even to learn it from a book or a site or something.    thanks.,android

safe remove usb/ sd card that is mounted as a folder  im asking this question as im not too sure if it can be done and if it can how to go about doing it.     i have a program that uses data that is stored on a usb/sd card but before it can carry out its tasks the storage (either sd card or usb) is mounted to a folder as opposed to coming into windows as a drive letter. for example say the mounted folder is c:\documents\sdcard.     my question is this. is there a way i can safe remove this storage in c# without unmounting the storage  any pointers is greatly appreciated. thanks,c#

questions about pulling object information from subclasses  my apologies if there are similar questions in regards to mine.  i m rather new to python  and still getting used to oop.  that being said  if one of the many kind souls in this community could help in regards to my specific situation  or point me in the direction of similar questions that have been asked  -- though i d like to note that googling was no help and each question w/ similar errors were so widely different  and spanned so many different projects  i had a hard time grasping the solutions -- it would be greatly appreciated.    let s say i have a file named  objects.py  to store most of my class objects for a text based game i m developing  and in that file i have a class named  occupation .  class  occupation  holds variables that are used as modifiers for the  player  class that will be described a little more later on.     the idea is that in the root file  namely  root.py   the player will be able to choose from a list of player occupations  e.g.  wizard  or  knight   and have the information from the respective occupation classes replace the current player variable information.      <em> player.py  file:</em>   <pre><code>import objects  class player(object):     nextlevel = 30     #  nextlevel  is the gold required for a level up.     def __init__(self):         self.name =            self.level = 1         self.health = 1         self.stamina = 0         self.mana = 0         self.skills = { str : 0   def : 0   dex : 0   int : 0   chr : 0   lck : 0}         self.spells = []         self.inventory = [{ armor : [objects.prisonerrobes()]   weapons : [objects.irondagger()]   bows : []   potions : []   misc : []}  objects.gold(0)  objects.arrow(0)]         self.victory = false </code></pre>   <em> objects.py  file:</em>   <pre><code>class occupation(object):     # base class for all occupations / classes  e.g.  knight  or  wizard .     classlist = [ warrior    knight    paladin    druid    warlock    wizard ]     def __init__(self  name  hp  sp  mp  strv  defv  dexv  intv  chrv  lckv):         # the variable names of  strv    defv   etc. stand for  strength value    defence value   etc.         self.name = name         self.health = health         self.stamina = stamina         self.mana = mana         self.strv = strv    #skill values         self.defv = defv             self.dexv = dexv         self.intv = intv         self.chrv = chrv         self.lckv = lckv      def __str__(self):         details =  {0}: hp: {1}  sp: {2}  mp: {3} // [str: {4}  def: {5}  dex: {6}  int: {7}  chr: {8}  lck: {9}]          return details.format(self.name  self.health  self.stamina  self.mana  self.strv  self.defv  self.dexv  self.intv  self.chrv  self.lckv)  class warrior(occupation):     def __init__(self):         super(warrior  self).__init__( warrior   75  50  25  12  8  12  5  8  5) </code></pre>   <em> root.py  file:</em>   <pre><code>from player import player import objects  def new_game():     while true:         print  only one class  and it is warrior!          print objects.warrior()         classchoice = raw_input( please type the full name of the class you wish to select.:  ).lower()         playerclass = classchoice.title()         if classchoice !=   :             characterclass = getattr(objects  playerclass)             player.health = characterclass.health             player.stamina = characterclass.stamina             player.mana = characterclass.mana             player.skills[ str ] = characterclass.strv             player.skills[ def ] = characterclass.defv             player.skills[ dex ] = characterclass.dexv             player.skills[ int ] = characterclass.intv             player.skills[ chr ] = characterclass.chrv             player.skills[ lck ] = characterclass.lckv             print  you have chosen {0} as your class. .format(characterclass.name)             confirm = raw_input( is this correct  type [y] or [n] for yes/no respectively.:  ).lower()             if confirm ==  y :                 break             elif confirm ==  n :                 continue             else:                 print  not a valid keystroke!                  continue </code></pre>   the problem appears when typing  warrior  when choosing a player class.:    <pre><code>line 48[in my original file]: player.health = characterclass.health attributeerror: type object  warrior  has no attribute  health  </code></pre>   it seems that i can t reference the variables that i want to  when trying to update pre-existing player values.  the  warrior  class  as far as i can tell  has the variable  health   but i can t seem to access it.  am i misunderstanding how classes and subclasses work in python   or is it something else     thanks for any help.,python

php - detect the character encoding of the file system  how to detect the character encoding of the file system that your script is currently running on weither it is on windows or linux     i have a form in wich the user will upload a file and give it a name. once uploaded and moved to the disired destination  files that have names like :   <pre><code>wéîrd nàmès </code></pre>   will be saved with names like :   <pre><code>wã©ã®r nã mã¨s </code></pre>   i tried <code>iconv</code> and <code>mb_convert_encoding</code> but i couldn t find out wich character encoding to use.    i don t want to detect the character encoding of the file itself. i want to detect the character encoding wich i will uses to save the file.    this is the php used to upload files :   <pre><code>mkdir ($webdir .  /files/location/  . $doc_name .  / );  if (!move_uploaded_file ($_files[ docx_file ][ tmp_name ]  $webdir .  /files/location/  . $doc_name .  /  . $doc_name .  .docx )){     echo  docx upload failed miserably.. ;     rmdir($webdir .  /files/location/  . $doc_name .  / ); }else{     echo  docx upload completed successfully! ; } </code></pre>   let s say that the file name is <strong>dédé</strong>    first i create the folder <code>$webdir .  /files/location/dédé </code>    then i move the uploaded file to <code>$webdir .  /files/location/dédé/dédé.docx </code>    if an error occurs while moving the file (wich doesn t happen) i delete the folder that i reacently created.    everything goes well exept for the folder and file names wich will be saved as <strong>dã©dã©</strong> . both of them.    i tried this before running the above script :   <pre><code>echo $doc_name .  \r\n ; echo (mb_detect_encoding($doc_name)) .  \r\n ; </code></pre>   and it gave me this result :   <pre><code>dédé utf-8 docx upload completed successfully! </code></pre>   can anyone help please.    <strong>edit</strong>    i added this before running the above script :   <pre><code>echo $doc_name .  \r\n ; echo (mb_detect_encoding($doc_name)) .  \r\n ;  $doc_name =  (mb_convert_encoding($doc_name   utf-8    ascii ));  echo $doc_name .  \r\n ; echo (mb_detect_encoding($doc_name)) .  \r\n ; </code></pre>   <code>$doc_name</code> have <strong>dédé</strong> inside it and is encoded in <strong>utf-8</strong>.    first it shows this :   <pre><code>dédé utf-8 </code></pre>   then i use <code>mb_convert_encoding</code> to convert it from <strong>ascii</strong> to <strong>utf-8</strong> and it shows this :   <pre><code>dã©dã© utf-8 </code></pre>   wich is exactly the file names used instead of <strong>dédé</strong>    is it possible that <code>mkdir</code> and <code>move_uploaded_file</code> are automatically converting the strings from <strong>ascii</strong> to <strong>utf-8</strong> before saving  is it possible that i have runned some function that makes this possible  i have a really long script running before this one and i can t really put it all here.,php
when to use strong  weak  retain etc   i m porting a small c++ app to osx and it s going well but one thing i don t understand are:    strong  weak  retain keywords in objective-c around properties and in what situations i should use them.  we don t have these same concepts in c++.    could someone please explain what they are and how they work because i ve searched and what i ve not found any good explanations of when to use them. all i know is they relate to reference counting.  but that s it.    currently  i ve just put strong everywhere.  but i suspect i shouldn t be doing that.,objective-c
jquery click to randomize number on string only triggered once  i need to randomize the number part of string on every click  hence 1 after sample should be randomized (<strong>sample1</strong>). i am concerned with the data-sample part  but showing the value as well to show the same click don t do any good. i suspect the number is just string on the following clicks.    js fiddle <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/clhsr/2/  rel= nofollow >sample</a>.    html:   <pre><code>&lt;input id= input  value= sample1  data-sample= sample1 /&gt; &lt;button id= button &gt;randomize&lt;/button&gt; </code></pre>   jquery:   <pre><code>  var newrandomnumber = (math.random()*10)+1;   $( #button ).click(function () {     var value = math.floor(newrandomnumber);     $( #input ).attr( data-sample     ).attr( data-sample    sample  + value).val( sample  + value);     return false;   }); </code></pre>   any hint is very much appreciated. thanks.,jquery

sql latest date  i thought i had it but it seemed i was wrong.    i have a query   <pre><code>select prestatiecode  uitvoerdatum  identificatie  foutmelding  from bam_zending_allinstances as zall left outer join bam_zending_completedrelationships as zrel on  zall.activityid = zrel.activityid left outer join bam_prestatie_allinstances as pall on  zrel.referencedata = pall.activityid where zall.zender =  bl15   and referencetype =  activity   and zendingnummer =  632  </code></pre>   this shows a list of prestatiecodes  also duplicates. now i only need to have a list of pretatiecodes without the duplicates  it should just pick the one with the lastest date. the datecolumn = uitvoerdatum.    i thought i d try something like:   <pre><code>select max(uitvoerdatum)  prestatiecode   from bam_zending_allinstances as zall left outer join bam_zending_completedrelationships as zrel on  zall.activityid = zrel.activityid left outer join bam_prestatie_allinstances as pall on  zrel.referencedata = pall.activityid where zall.zender =  bl15   and referencetype =  activity   and zendingnummer =  632  group by prestatiecode </code></pre>   which gives me what i want. however as you can notice it does not have the 2 columns  identificatie  and foutmelding. if i add these it gives me the error   <pre><code>column  bam_prestatie_allinstances.identificatie  is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the group by clause. </code></pre>   so i m guessing my approach is wrong. i need to see all the columns but only for the latest  prestatiecode s.    am i making any sense,sql

attempted to read or write protected memory. this is often an indication that other memory is corrupt  i have a application that clients connect to via socket. the application is multi threaded  does lots of number crunching  and consumes a huge ammount of memory. (1.5 - 2 gb) occasionally it throws this error in a seemingly simple area of code.     attempted to read or write protected memory. this is often an indication that other memory is corrupt.    its not always on the same line  but its always in the same file  on a foreach loop. i m wondering if theres some setting in vs 2008 thats causing it  theres nothing weird going on it really just dies on a foreach loop iterating through a list.  i m pretty sure its not a threading issue because i am using lock() so i m 100% sure that the lists arnt getting modified by multiple threads at the same time. i ve tried turning off compiler optimizations but it still does it every once in a while. very annoying.    this is a very very rare occurance. i m running the server in debug and this only happens like once every 12-48 hours.,.net

redirect to google play store if required app needed by notification doesn t exist  i am using <code>notificationmanager</code> to display some notifications to the user on android. when clicked on the notification  <code>myapp</code> is supposed to launch and open a file  which it does.    <pre><code>intent intent1 = new intent(intent.action_view  uri.parse(uri.tostring())); //uri is the custom uri which is something like  myapp:filename   pendingintent pintent = pendingintent.getactivity(this  0  intent1  0); notification.builder notify = new notification.builder(this)                     .setcontenttitle( tap here )                     .setsmallicon(launcher)                     .setcontenttext( some text )                     .setcontentintent(pintent).setautocancel(true); notificationmanager notificationmanager = (notificationmanager) getsystemservice(notification_service);  notificationmanager.notify(0  notify.build()); </code></pre>   however  what i also want is to be redirected to the <code>playstore</code> if the app does not exist. i do not know how to achieve this.     i have read <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25266336/launching-an-application-if-installed-or-redirect-to-google-play >here</a> that we can use <code>packagemanager</code> to check whether the app exists or not. so  one way to achieve my goal is to go to an activity upon the clicking of notification where i check the existence of app and then decide accordingly.    what i want to know is that whether there exists a more sophisticated way to do this      edit: by sophisticated  i mean is there any other standard way to do this  or the option i suggested is the standard one.,android

problems with pass-by-reference in objc  i wanna do pass by reference in objc.  here is the illustration of the scenario:   <pre><code>// mainclass.h @interface mainclass {     board *board;     otherclass *other; } @end  // mainclass.m @implementation mainclass  - (id)init {    if (self = [super init])    {       board = [[board alloc] init];       other = [[otherclass alloc] initotherclasswithboard: board];    }    return self }  @end  // other class.h @interface otherclass {    board *refboard; } - (void)initotherclasswithboard: (board*)ref; @end  @implementation otherclass  - (id)initotherclasswithboard: (board*)ref {     if (self = [super init])     {        refboard = ref;     }     return self; }  @end </code></pre>   so my question is does my otherclass is holding a reference board from mainclass  or otherclass s board is a copy but not a reference. if i wanna do a reference then how should i change it     edit: what if i add this on both classes   <pre><code>@property (nonatomic  retain) board *board; </code></pre>,objective-c
how to check if a file exists without also checking if i got the permission to read it   file.exists and fileinfo.exists can t be used in this case  as they check if the file exists and the permission levels are sufficient.    is there an easy way to check if a file exists regardless of the permissions     the context of the problem is a common one: asking the user if they really want to overwrite an existing file. you seldom want to overwrite a file you don t own  and a call to file.exists would miss that case and confuse it with the file not existing.,.net

c: how do i edit a line in an existing text file   im attempting to create a program that replaces 1 line in a text file  if that line matches a specific pattern  with a new line. i ve been looking at some simple functions but none of them does what i want (<a href= http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_file_io.htm  rel= nofollow >http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_file_io.htm</a>). i guess that i could create a new textfile and write the lines that needs to be changed to that file and copy the lines over that needs to remain the same but i could imagine it would be easier having 1 file.    so here is my question  is it possible to replace one line with another in an existing file,c

class properties that aren t always populated. what is best practice   i have a class which models online campaigns i.e. people clicking through to the site from affiliate websites  and we need to record all these clicks and any purchases that are made. this class has the usual crap - name  start date  end date etc. - which we need to return and i have a constructor which populates these values. all very standard and all very fine. i ve done all the standard getall and getbyid functions which use that constructor to populate the object.     however  in one case i need to return a list of the campaigns with their totals e.g. total clicks  total purchases etc. these clicks  / purchases are stored in a separate db table and the totals will be calculated using an sql aggragate function. i could call a function which would get the total clicks and then another to get the total purchases for each campaign as we loop through them  but that would mean two extra database calls for each campaign returned.     another option would be to always return the totals when you search for a campaign  but this is putting unnecessary work on the db as the clicks table could get quite large quite quickly and doing aggregate functions on that wouldn t be a good idea.     i finally thought of declaring public properties totalclicks and totalpurchases which aren t populated in the constructor  but only when you call the specific getthetotals function. this is grand  but it means that when you are accessing an instance of the campaign object you could try objcampaign.totalclicks even though it is probably not set.    i know i could just return a dataset  but that just doesn t seem right from an object oriented point of view. any idea what the correct approach is here,.net

member function as friend: is the book lippman 5th wrong   lippman 5th isbn-13: 978-0321714114    page 280-281  it says:   <blockquote>    <strong>making a member function a friend</strong>        rather than making the entire  window_mgr class a friend  screen can   instead specify that only the clear member is allowed  access. when we   declare a member function to be a friend  we must specify the class of   which that function is a member:   <pre><code>class screen {     // window_mgr::clear must have been declared before class screen     friend void window_mgr::clear(screenindex);     // ... rest of the screen class }; </code></pre>       making a member function a friend requires careful structuring of our   programs to accommodate interdependencies among the declarations and   definitions. in this example  we must order our program as follows:       <ul>   <li>first  define the window_mgr class  which declares  but cannot define  clear. screen must be declared before clear can use the   members of screen.</li>   <li>next  define class screen  including a friend declaration for clear.</li>   <li>finally  define clear  which can now refer to the members in screen.</li>   </ul> </blockquote>   the problem is: class window_mgr has a data member that depends of class screen definition. see:   <pre><code>class window_mgr { public:     // location id for each screen on the window     using screenindex = std::vector&lt;screen&gt;::size_type;     // reset the screen at the given position to all blanks     void clear(screenindex); private:     std::vector&lt;screen&gt; screens{screen(24  80     )}; }; </code></pre>   so it is impossible firstly define window_mgr without defining screen previously! and at the same time  it is impossible define screen without we have defined window_mgr!!!    how can this problem be solved    is the book wrong     i will paste here a code so that you can repeat the problem using a minimal code:   <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt;  class a {     friend void b::hello();  public:     a(int i) : number{i} {}  private:     void f() {         std::cout &lt;&lt;  hello  &lt;&lt; std::endl;     }     int number; };  class b { private:     std::vector&lt;a&gt; x{a(10)};  public:     void hello()     {         for(a &amp;elem : x)         {             elem.f();         }     } };   int main() {     a x;      return 0; } </code></pre>   if i compile this code  the result is: error: use of undeclared identifier  b       friend void b::hello();    and if i invert the position (a &lt;--> b)  i have: error: use of undeclared identifier  a       std::vector x{a(10)};    is there a correct way to do that      thank you!   <hr>   edit:    thank you  craig young    solution:   <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt;  class a;  class b { private:     std::vector&lt;a&gt; x;  public:     b();     void hello();  };  class a {     friend void b::hello();  public:     a(int i) : number{i} {}  private:     void f() {         std::cout &lt;&lt;  hello  &lt;&lt; std::endl;     }     int number; };  b::b() : x{a(10)} {  }  void b::hello() {     for(a &amp;elem : x)     {         elem.f();     } }  int main() {       return 0; } </code></pre>   conclusion:   <ul> <li>the book is incomplete in that it doesn t expose the necessity of doing the forward declaration of class a firstly and the impossibility to do in-class initialization in this case. </li> <li>i didn t notice that the problem was the a(10)  not the vector! that is  we can use incomplete type a (only declaration  without definition) when we are using it as template argument to vector (because it doesn t create a object itself) but we can not use incomplete type a when defining a object  for example: a(10);</li> </ul>,c++

java:is it possible to name a collection   i was wanting to put my own unique identifier for my collection instances. hashcodes can uniquely identify a collection but that is not what i am looking for. something like this..   <pre><code>list&lt;integer&gt; classonestudentids = arrays.aslist(123 135); classonestudentids.name =  classone ; list&lt;integer&gt; classtwostudentids = arrays.aslist(145 138); classtwostudentids.name =  classtwo ; </code></pre>   it does not appear to be possible...    not very relevant when the code is non-recursive and the main program knows what the lists stand for. however  for recursive solutions  i can see it being helpful that the collection is able to identify itself based on what the programmer has named it.     for the following snippet for tower of hanoi solution  it would help to not have to use hashcode but rather a meaningful name relevant to the use case at hand..   <pre><code>   integer elem = pegone.removefirst();    system.out.println( move element   + elem +   from   +      pegone.hashcode());    pegthree.add(elem);    system.out.println(  to   + pegthree.hashcode()); </code></pre>   is there a way for a collection to identify itself,java

how to cache views in android   i m building an app which generate some labels and views dynamically.   i defined how my  custom view  should look in a xml layout and from code i inflate this layout.     because the inflated layout will be always the same  i want to make this step just one time.   after i have the layout  i want to cache it and use it next time when i will need it.    the problem is that if i put my inflated layout in cache (in a hashmap by example) and add it to a parent layout  next time when i try to add it again (this time i will get the layout from cache) the system says that my layout already have a parent.     do you know any method to detach a child view from parent without removing the child view     added some code:   <pre><code>    private static hashmap&lt;string  linearlayout&gt; mcomponentscache;  // inflate and add the layout in cache layout = (linearlayout)mlf.inflate(r.layout.form_textbox  mholder  false); mcomponentscache.put(formfieldtype.type_text  layout); </code></pre>,android

rails beginner - which controller to put functions in   new to rails and i have what i think is a basic question.     in an admin view  there will be varying operations done on different data models. i have a layout  admin  which has various tabs the user clicks to load forms to edit various sets of data.     should the controller for everything that can be edited in this view be in admin_controller (ie  have an edit_product  edit_user...)  or is it better to leave the functions in the controller for each model (say users_controller  products_controller  orders_controller) and specify in the controllers to use the admin layout     i m working through my first rails project  and it seems either way works  but obviously i want to follow the right convention going forward so any hint  or a link to an article about this topic would be appreciated.    thanks,ruby-on-rails

how do i convert strings of digits into lists of digits with proper spacing   i have a string of digits:   <pre><code>grades=  50 20 1 55 90  </code></pre>   how do i want convert this into a lists  when i try to use the list() function i get    <pre><code>[ 5    0         2    0         1         5    5         9    0 ] </code></pre>   which makes life hard man. i need them in the format:   <pre><code>[50  20  1  55  90] </code></pre>   i tried coming up with a solution of my own which would loop through each element  checking if the string was a digit  and then appending them together until it got to a space  which would make the whole appended digit be appended to another list. this seemed overly complex. there <strong>must</strong> be another way!,python
objective-c should i be using nserror and why presenterror function not working  i am creating an application on iphone where i am taking code written and java and translating into objective-c  as the app must work similarly in both android and iphone. now problems of course are there are certain areas where the languages differ quite a bit  and can be difficult to implement just right.    one of the areas where it is of course different is you cannot create nsmutablearrays or nsmutabledictionaries which only accepts objects of a certain type. so when i am creating the getters and setters for these objects  i have been doing this  example below:   <pre><code>  -(void)setperson:(nsmutablearray *)personlist_p     {         bool ballowed = yes;         for(int i = 0; i &lt; [personlist_p count]; i++)         {             if(![[personlist_p objectatindex:i] iskindofclass:[person class]])             {                 ballowed = no;                 break;             }             else             {                 ballowed = yes;             }         }          if(ballowed)         {         personlist_i = personlist_p;         }         else         {         //raise error here         }     } </code></pre>   now originally i was using nsraise exception  but after doing reading up on it  it recommends against this as exception handling is resource intensive and should not be used for this type of situation. so nserror i read was a good solution  so i was reading up on this guide   <blockquote>    <a href= http://www.cimgf.com/2008/04/04/cocoa-tutorial-using-nserror-to-great-effect/  rel= nofollow >http://www.cimgf.com/2008/04/04/cocoa-tutorial-using-nserror-to-great-effect/</a>  </blockquote>   my question is two fold  if i decide to use nserror should  is it best practice to declare the nserror object in the method  i.e like this   <pre><code>-(void)setperson:(nsmutablearray *)personlist_p : (nserror **)error </code></pre>   or is it okay just to declare the error within the else statement above  like this   <pre><code> nserror *error = nil;          nsmutabledictionary* details = [nsmutabledictionary dictionary];                 [details setvalue:@ invalid object passed into array  object must be of type person.  forkey:nslocalizeddescriptionkey];                 error = [nserror errorwithdomain:@ invalid object  code:200 userinfo:details];                 nslog(@ %@   [error localizeddescription]); </code></pre>   secondly  in the guide i linked above  in the conclusion the author says   <blockquote>    in this example  i am checking to see if the error is still nil after   my message call. if it is no longer nil i know that an error occurred   and that i need to display it to the user. apple provides a built in   method to do this with a call to presenterror: on the nsapplication   instance  </blockquote>   and he uses this line of code here   <pre><code>[nsapp presenterror:error]; </code></pre>   this does not work for me  i do not get an autocomplete option with this code  just says use of undeclared identifier. am i missing something obvious here     also  just to be sure  is the method i am using  the best method to go about ensuring the user sends in an array with the correct object types  or is there another method which could be used which would achieve the same thing but in a more efficient manner.    thanks in advance!!    edit:    additional question  would it be such a bad idea to use nsexception  as the problem with nserror is the app carries on  i am considering having it so if they do pass in an array with an invalid object  that it does just cause the application to crash and raise an exception. is there any major reason why i shouldn t do this,objective-c

is there a way to send json collection as a resource and not in the javascript as an object   i am new to angular and trying to study it  so this might be basic. on my web server i have a list of myobject. in every angularjs example i see a serialized collection passed as a written object in javascript.       something like this:   <pre><code>$scope.services = [     {         name:  web development           price: 300          active:true     } {         name:  design           price: 400          active:false     } {         name:  integration           price: 250          active:false     } {         name:  training           price: 220          active:false     } ]; </code></pre>   this looks  in the final javascript  a bit too hard-coded.  is there another way i can send this json  (i.e. in .net i can use razor but i still need to dynamically build it as a string).    is there another way i can send my json  but not in javascript  perhaps as a resource and bind to it,angularjs

strcat operation with tabs character not working  i am tring to convert an integer array <code>attr</code> of length <code>numattr</code> to string but separated by tabs <code> \t </code> using the below code. if <code>attr[i] = 0</code>  i add just a tab <code> \t </code> to <code>attrstr</code> so that that field is empty string. if <code>attr[i] !=0</code>  i convert the integer to string and add to <code>attrstr</code>. but on doing <code>strcat(attrstr  \t )</code>  no tab character is added to the string. is there anything specific that i am missing  i hope i am using <code>strcat</code> operation in the right way though. below is the code:   <pre><code>char *attrstr = new char[len]; strcpy(attrstr   ); char *buf = new char[buflen]; strcpy(buf   ); int i = 0; for (i=0; i&lt;numattr-1; i++) {     if (attr[i]!=0) {         itoa(attr[i] buf 10);          strcat(buf  \t );          strcat(attrstr  buf);     } else {         strcpy(buf  \t );          strcat(attrstr  buf);     } } itoa(attr[i] buf 10); strcat(attrstr  buf); return attrstr; </code></pre>,c++
my logger keeps getting destructed while i am trying to log errors and exceptions  i am just now switching back to php after enterprise open-source java development for three years.  now i am tasked with updating our platform for better logging.    i now understand better how the php object lifecycle regarding when objects are garbage collected and have trapped my problem.  i am trying to invoke the logger after its already been destructed  when a fatal error occurs.  my question is  how do i fix this   how can i stop an object from being destroyed until the end of the request       ideally i would like to keep this logger around in memory like i would in java but is that even possible with php   is there anything shared between two different threads or requests,php
sql returning a sum and a single value from a table on a condition  i have a table that contains the product  warehouse number (numbered 1-8)  quantity-on-hand  and list-price for inventory items.  each line contains specific data for a particular warehouse.  we have 8 warehouses in total  so each product has 8 lines associated with it in the table.    i need to return the product  the sum of the quantity-on-hand for all 8 warehouses  but only want to show the unique list-price for a selected warehouse.  i can use the sum aggregate function with a group-by to return the correct summation of the quantity-on-hand  but can t figure out how display the unique list-price for one particular warehouse within the same query.,sql

how to check if value already exists   i have a small app that users can use to search for a movie  and then add it to their watchlist. currently it is possible to add 1 movie multple times for the same user. which ofcourse isn t expected behaviour.    my solution would be to find the unique id of the movie that s being added and crosscheck that with my <code>movies_users</code> data. if the <code>movie_id</code> value exists  do this  else do this.    at the moment i do have the unique movie id of the movie that s being added    <pre><code>$scope.movielistid = response; console.log ($scope.movielistid.id) </code></pre>   which gets ouputted like a string  like so    <pre><code>314365 </code></pre>   and i got the movie records from the current user    <pre><code>$scope.moviescheck = response.data; console.log ($scope.moviescheck) </code></pre>   which looks like this    <pre><code>[{ id :2  title : black panther    movie_id : 284054 }] </code></pre>   so what would be a good way to check if the result from <code>$scope.movielistid.id</code> already exists in the <code>$scope.moviescheck</code> data     <strong>* update *</strong>    trying a suggestion below does not give the expected result.   <pre><code>var exists = function (id) {   $scope.moviescheck.foreach(function (movie) {     console.log (movie.movie_id)     console.log (id)     if (movie.movie_id === id)       console.log ( duplicate )     else       console.log ( not duplicate )    }); }  exists($scope.movielistid.id); </code></pre>   the console.log output from this is    <pre><code>312221 312221 not duplicate </code></pre>   which clearly are duplicate results.,angularjs

how to rename a bunch of files using python   i am a complete beginner in python. i need to rename a bunch of files with dates in the name. the names all look like:   <ul> <li><code>front 7.25.16</code></li> <li><code>left 7.25.16</code></li> <li><code>right 7.25.16</code></li> </ul>   i would like them to start with the date rather then <em>front</em>  <em>left</em>  or <em>right</em>  so that <code>front 7.25.16</code> becomes <code>7.25.16 front</code>.    i have tried using <em>regular expressions</em> and <em>os.walk</em> and i have run into troubles with both. right now i am just trying to print the file names to prove <em>os.walk</em> is working. right now my code looks like this:   <pre class= lang-python prettyprint-override ><code>import re  shutil  os  k = re.compile(r (\d+.\d+.\d+) ) re_date = k.search( front 7.25.16 )  for root  dirs  filenames in os.walk( path ):     for filename in filenames:         print ( the filename is:   + filename)     print (  ) </code></pre>   any advice would be greatly appreciated.,python

program using pointers in c crashes. unable to find the mistake  i have written a program which accepts the number of students and the number of subjects. i need to accepts the marks in all subjects for each student and print each students total marks. i have used pointers instead of an array since we do not know the number of students/subjects. the function causing the problem might be this one: n=students m=subjects and sm is a pointer object of a structure which contains pointer  marks .   <pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt; #include&lt;math.h&gt; #include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;  void accept(int int); //function prototype void calc(int int);//function prototype void print(int);//function prototype struct student{     float *marks; }*sm; float *total; int main(){     int n m;     printf( enter number of students(n) and number of subjects(m) \n );     scanf( %d%d  &amp;n &amp;m);     sm=malloc(n);     sm-&gt;marks=malloc(m);     total=malloc(n);     accept(n m);     calc(n m);     print(n);     return 0; } void accept(int n int m){ //accepts data     int i p;     for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++){     printf( enter the marks of student %d in each subject in order and separated by a space/line \n  i+1);     for(p=0;p&lt;m;p++){         scanf( %f  (sm+i)-&gt;marks+p);         }     } } void calc(int n int m){ //calculates total marks     int i p tot=0;     for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++){         for(p=0;p&lt;m;p++){             tot+=*((sm+i)-&gt;marks+p);         }         *(total+i)=tot;         tot=0;     } } void print(int n){//print the total marks of each student     int i tot=0;     for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++){         printf( total marks for student %d is:%0.2f \n  i+1 *(total+i));     } } </code></pre>   the program crashes whenever the number of students>1 . i do not understand why and i have tried many ways to fix it but none have worked so far. what is my mistake,c

html tag  readonly  changes depending on computer   how is it possible that the homepage www.ebookers.com has  readonly  html tags  depending on what computer i open it from  concretely:   <ul> <li>if i open the page from my desktop in chrome  i am able to type in dates with my keyboard</li> <li>if i open the page from my laptop  same win10  same chrome  same wifi  the date fields are  readonly  and i can only use the datepicker to input dates. </li> </ul>   if i use incognito mode or firefox  it is consistent  it seems just to depend on the machine i sit at whether a tag is there on a homepage. granted i know very little about web development  but this is completely bamboozling to me  it makes no sense.     any insight would be greatly appreciated. especially if there is a way to disable/circumvent that readonly mode  as this would facilitate my selenium scripting considerably. thanks!,html

sql how to find if all values from one field exist in another field in any order  i am trying to match data from an external source to an in house source. for example one table would have a field with a value of  black blue  and another table would have a field with a value of  blue black .  i am trying to figure out how to check if all individual words in the first table are contained in a record the 2nd table in any order. it s not always two words that need to be compared it could be 3 or 4 as well. i know i could use a cursor and build dynamic sql substituting the space with the and keywod and using the contains function but i m hoping not to have to do that.     any help would be much appreciated.,sql

loop array of objects  compare key values  i have an array of objects  all with the same keys. i want to check if 2 keys  in this case  a  &amp;  b  from all objects  have the same value. meaning a === a and b === b  across all objects.   <pre><code>var arr = [{a: x   b:2  c:3  d:4} {a:1  b:2  c:3  d:4} {a:1  b:2  c:3  d:4} {a:1  b:2  c:3  d:4}]; </code></pre>   if one of the key values(a or b) doesn t match the others  i want to return false. this case should return false because  a  in arr[0] =  x   while all the others equal 1;    here s my attempt. obviously doesnt work but what i was attempting was to have 2 loops compare 2 objects at a time. for example  the first loop will start at arr[0] and second loop will start at arr[1]  compare then move onto comparing arr[3] with arr[4] and so on. though the length of the array wont always be even.   <pre><code>function comparekeyvals(arr){    for(var i = 0; i&lt;arr.length; i+=2){     for(var j = 1; j&lt;arr.length; j+=2){      for(key in arr[i]){              for(keyz in arr[j]){                 if(key ===  a  &amp;&amp; keyz ===  a ){             if(arr[i][key] != arr[j][keyz]){               return false;             }           }           }       }         }   } }  comparekeyvals(arr); </code></pre>   thanks.,javascript

proxy wrapper classes  operator-> chaining  i ve found <a href= http://www.stroustrup.com/wrapper.pdf  rel= nofollow noreferrer >this paper</a> implementing a c++ proxy wrapper class  which allows code execution before and after each method call by overloading <code>operator-&gt;</code>.    in section 11  techniques it is mentioned that it is possible to chain wrapper classes into each other  like   <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std;  template&lt;class t  class pref  class suf&gt; class wrap; template&lt;class t  class suf&gt; class call_proxy {   t* p;   mutable bool own;   suf suffix;   call_proxy(t* pp  suf su) :p(pp)   own(true)   suffix(su) { } // restrict creation   call_proxy&amp; operator=(const call_proxy&amp;) ; // prevent assignment   public:   template&lt;class u  class p  class s&gt; friend class wrap;   call_proxy(const call_proxy&amp; a) : p(a.p)   own(true)   suffix(a.suffix) { a.own=false; }   ~call_proxy() { if (own) suffix() ; }    t* operator-&gt;() const{ return p;} // error: ‘struct shared&lt;x&gt;’ has no member named ‘g’   //t&amp; operator-&gt;() const{ return *p;} // error: result of ‘operator-&gt;()’ yields non-pointer result };   template&lt;class t  class  pref  class suf&gt; class  wrap {   t&amp; p;   pref prefix;   suf suffix; public:   wrap(t&amp; x   pref pr  suf su) :p(x)   prefix(pr)   suffix(su) { }   call_proxy&lt;t suf&gt; operator-&gt;() const{        prefix() ;        return  call_proxy&lt;t suf&gt;(&amp;p suffix);    } };  void prefix() { cout &lt;&lt;  prefix  ; } void suffix() { cout &lt;&lt;   suffix\n ; } struct pref { void operator()() const{ cout&lt;&lt;   pref  ; } }; struct suf { void operator()() const{ cout&lt;&lt;   suf  ; } };  template&lt;class t&gt; struct shared : public wrap&lt;t pref  suf&gt; {    shared(t&amp; obj) : wrap&lt;t pref  suf&gt;(obj pref()   suf()) { } }; template&lt;class t&gt; struct tracer : public wrap&lt;t void(*)()  void(*)()&gt;  {      tracer(t&amp; x) : wrap&lt;t void(*)()  void(*)()&gt;(x ::prefix ::suffix) { }  };  class x { public:     void g() const{ cout &lt;&lt;  g() ; } };  int main() {// test program   x x;   shared&lt;x&gt; xx(x) ;   tracer&lt;shared&lt;x&gt;&gt; xxx(xx);    xx-&gt;g();   xxx-&gt;g();   return 0; } </code></pre>   but this fails with the error <code>error: ‘struct shared&lt;x&gt;’ has no member named ‘g’</code>. i read about <code>operator-&gt;</code> overloading and understand the problem (<code>call_proxy</code> returns a pointer  which does not propagate the overloading  as mentioned <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4923270 >here</a>).    i tried some alternatives by returning reference instead of pointer  but in the end i have either the problem mentioned above  or the problem that <code>operator-&gt;</code> is called on a reference type (<code>error: result of ‘operator-&gt;()’ yields non-pointer result</code>).    is there a way to achieve this  as it was mentioned in the paper  i thought it should be possible.   <hr>   edit: code versions for both errors.   <ul> <li><a href= http://ideone.com/ff9uyn  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://ideone.com/ff9uyn</a> (<code>error: ‘struct shared&lt;x&gt;’ has no member named ‘g’</code>. i read about <code>operator-&gt;</code>)</li> <li><a href= http://ideone.com/cv93qx  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://ideone.com/cv93qx</a> (<code>error: result of ‘operator-&gt;()’ yields non-pointer result</code>)</li> </ul>   both versions are the same  with line 17 or line 18 commented out.,c++
creating a program in c to generate primes  i am trying to generate a list of all the prime numbers for the first 1000 numbers. i am not sure where i am going wrong in my code. from what i can tell my nested for loop is not reading dividing/reading the array correctly and then assigning that array the proper value. any insight would be much appreciated. the program currently only generates all the odd numbers.   <pre><code>int main() {      int x = 1;     int arr[500];     int i  j  k;     int counter;     int primearray[500];      for (j=0; j &lt;= 500; j++) {         x += 2;         arr[j] = x;          for (k = 1; k &lt;= 15; k++) {             counter = x%k;             if (counter == 0) {                 primearray[j] = x;             } else {                 break;             }         }          for (i = 0; i &lt; 500; i++) {             printf( %d    primearray[i]);     } } </code></pre>,c

issue with my custom navigation bar back button xcode  i m working in xcode 4.3.2 using storyboards. i ve created a segue between two views by clicking on the button i want to create a segue and control+click+drag a connection to the next view controller. of course this creates an automatic/default back button in the navigation bar in the next view controller.  what i want to do is customize the look of this back button. so  i looked around online and found this code:   <pre><code>self.navigationitem.hidesbackbutton = yes; uibutton *button = [[uibutton alloc] initwithframe:cgrectmake(0  4  40  40)]; [button setimage:[uiimage imagenamed:@ homebutton.png ] forstate:uicontrolstatenormal]; [button addtarget:self action:@selector(backaction) forcontrolevents:uicontroleventtouchupinside]; uibarbuttonitem *back = [[uibarbuttonitem alloc] initwithcustomview:button]; self.navigationitem.leftbarbuttonitem = back; </code></pre>   it works great to change the look of the button  but the problem now is that when i click that button  xcode throws an error:  unrecognized error sent to instance...     can anyone help me to figure out how to now add the proper functionality to my custom back button  thanks.,ios

view criteria in rails controller  if a post has a <code>status</code> column in the database that has either value <code>draft</code> or <code>published</code>  how do i define <code>index</code> in my controller to show only <code>status</code> with <code>published</code>  i know i can achieve this using <code>if-else</code> in my view  but i wonder if there is a better approach in the controller.    thanks.,ruby-on-rails

explanation of memory allocation for array of pointers to fixed size arrays  i have a program that i ve written that requires me to declare an array as such   <pre><code>float (*array)[3] = new float[faces * 3][3]; </code></pre>   now i understand the syntax and all  this is an array of pointers to fixed size arrays. what i don t understand is the underlying organization behind this. since there was only one memory allocation (for the array of pointers) how does the memory for the fixed size arrays get allocated     along the same thread  since there was only one allocation there should be one deletion  meaning the array is deleted by   <pre><code>delete[] array; </code></pre>   but i m confused as to how this gets all of the memory  given that it seems only the array of pointers has been deleted  as opposed to the memory they pointed to.,c++

using uitableview without a controller - getting unrecognized selector error  i m not sure if i m going about this right. all the tutorials i ve seen suggest that nearly all the controls  which are views  are handled by their own viewcontroller. but the apple docs clearly state that it should be one viewcontroller per screen  and i have more than one thing going on per screen. if i m supposed to have multiple viewcontrollers per screen  how do i hook that up in ib     i ve put a uitableview onto my main view  and then i created a custom class to handle it. i implemented the uitableviewdatasource and uitableviewdelegate protocols necessary  and then i added it as an object into my xib file. i hooked up the table to that object  and i made sure to set the class of the object to the one i created.    the problem is  simply having a <code>willselectrowatindexpath</code> method defined in my custom class causes the app to crash when i click a table row  with an  unrecognized selector  error. i ve gone through dozens of forums and such looking for the answer  but they re all about making sure the class is set right (mine is) or something about leaking memory (for people who didn t use ib to create it.) so i m totally at a loss now for why this is happening. is it because my custom class isn t a subclass of uiviewcontroller     edit: i fixed the actual issue by moving the code into my main uiviewcontroller  and setting the table s datasource and delegate to that (the file s owner) and it works. but i m still very confused on why it refused to work before. all the links and properties seem to have been set up just fine.,iphone

c++ weird istringstream behaviour  i apologise for being a c++ novice. i am trying to learn by translating some code from java.    in this code  the strings that are read in represent letter frequencies in % in a language.    the test string we are dealing with is <code>a10b10c10d10e10f50</code>  as the test code shows.    in the loop below  the first 3 values (0.1  0 1  0.1) are correctly read in  as are the 5th and 6th (0.1 and 0.5)  but for some reason the 4th value for letter  d   when <code>i</code> is 9  is read in as <code>1000000000.0000000</code>  according to the debugger in visual studio. any ideas why    <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; #include &lt;sstream&gt; #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;cmath&gt;  using namespace std;  class symbolfrequency { public:     double language(vector &lt;string&gt; frequencies  vector &lt;string&gt; text) {          for (unsigned int fset = 0; fset &lt; frequencies.size(); fset++) {             double expected[26];             fill(expected  expected + 26  0.0);             for(unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; frequencies[fset].length(); i += 3) {                 char letter = frequencies[fset][i];                 istringstream is(frequencies[fset].substr(i + 1  i + 3));                 double freq;                 is &gt;&gt; freq; freq /= 100;                 expected[letter -  a ] = freq;             } ... </code></pre>   test code:   <pre><code>int main() {     symbolfrequency s;     const char *fargs[] = { a10b10c10d10e10f50 };     vector&lt;string&gt; f(fargs  fargs + 1);     vector&lt;string&gt; t;     t.push_back( abcde g );     double d = s.language(f t);     cout &lt;&lt; (d) &lt;&lt; endl;     cin.get();     return 0; } </code></pre>,c++
errata on  learn objective-c on the mac  book or bad memory understanding   in the book  learn objective-c on the mac  you can find the following code which i think is an errata:   <hr>    here s another attempt at writing setengine:   <pre><code>- (void) setengine: (engine *) newengine   {         [engine release];         engine = [newengine retain];   } </code></pre>   ... ponder this case:   <pre><code>engine *engine = [engine new]; // count: 1   car *car1 = [car new];   car *car2 = [car new];   [car1 setengine: engine]; // count: 2  [engine release]; // count 1   [car2 setengine: [car1 engine]]; //ops... </code></pre>   why is this a problem  here s what s happening. [car engine] returns a pointer to engine which has a retain count of 1. the first line of setengine is [engine release]  which makes the retain count 0  an the object gets deallocated....    <hr>   however  after reading this paragraph on page 166. i wonder what the internal engine reference in car2 has to do with engine in car1. they are two different references and by te time  [car2 setengine: [car1 engine]]  is invoke  the engine in car2 hasn t been initialized and keeps no relation to the retained engine the author talks about. so  [engine release]  won t decrease te counter to 0 of car1 engine. see my point  is it an errata or am i terrible wrong     ((i would like to discuss this particular code  not the right way of implementing a setter)),objective-c

how do i check if a specific key was released on keyboard   i want to check whether the escape key has been pressed/released in javascript.    they way i ve seen is this :   <pre><code>document.addeventlistener( keyup   function(event) {    //returns a number for key     console.log(event.keycode);    }); </code></pre>   however when i went onto mozilla it says the  .keycode  is being deprecated use  .key  instead. which i did but when i changed the code to this:   <pre><code>document.addeventlistener( keyup   function(event) {    //returns a number for key     console.log(event.key);    }); </code></pre>   it wouldn t work it said in the console  undefined . any ideas why      also is mozilla the best place to go  because as a beginner i m finding it difficult to understand. thanks,javascript

iphone screen dimensions considerations  sorry  i feel this will be pretty basic answer.    as i understand it the iphone screen is 320 x 480 points.    the status bar is 20 points high.    does this not mean that your working space should be 460 points high     it s just that when i drag out an imageview  even with the status bar visible  the panel on the right says it is 480 points high.    also  how best to allow for extra bars at the top  (such as personal hotspot connected)  i believe they push the screen down  should all images be set to aspect fit or something,ios

is there a more reliable way to display images on a webpage when loaded from the database   i have a system where you can view photos as an extra detail to a record. let s say it is a photo of an employee s cat.<br> these photos are stored in our database.    currently when someone wishes to view the kitty. we render an <code>img</code> tag like so.   <pre><code>&lt;a href= #  onclick= rendertag( 20 );return false; &gt;view kitty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div id= imagediv &gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;script src= http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.0/jquery.min.js  type= text/javascript &gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type= text/javascript &gt; function rendertag(id){     $( #imagediv ).html( &lt;img src= http://localhost/getkitty.aspx id=  + id +    /&gt; ); } &lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>   and the getkitty.aspx works like so   <pre><code>protected void page_load(object sender  eventargs e) {     response.clear();     response.addheader( content-disposition   attachment;filename=kitty.bmp );     response.contenttype =  image/bmp ;     response.cache.setlastmodified(datetime.now);     response.cache.setcacheability(httpcacheability.nocache);     bitmap kitty = getkittybitmap(request.querystring( id ));     kitty.save(response.outputstream  kitty.rawformat);     response.flush();     response.close();     kitty.dispose(); } </code></pre>   after clicking the anchor link the page is like so.<br> <img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/smlha.png  alt= enter image description here >    the problem is that sometimes the kitty doesn t show up on our mobile devices and my users get frustrated and call someone who is in the office to take a picture of the kitty with their mobile phone and email the kitty picture to them.     the demand for emailed pictures of kitties is so great that they are now asking for email functionality of sending kitty pictures be built into the system.    building that functionality could be avoided if the darn pictures of the kitties would just render all the time as expected.    is there a more reliable method of displaying images that are stored in the database,asp.net

overloading swap function in c++ class  i am trying to implement a swap function  that overrides the copy constructor and ultimately will allow me to use the equal  =  operator.  the issue is when testing my swap function i get junk values for everything in other(isneg is a bool  digits is an unsiged int* array  and numdigits is the size of  digits.<br> a reallylongint is an unsigned int* array of size numdigits  i have thoroughly tested my constructors and they work for both strings and long longs.    here is the declaration (reallylongint.cc) :   <pre><code>void reallylongint::swap(reallylongint other) {    //sets temporary values to equal others values   unsigned int* temp = new unsigned int[this-&gt;numdigits];    std::swap(this-&gt;digits  other.digits);   std::swap(this-&gt;numdigits  other.numdigits);   std::swap(this-&gt;isneg  other.isneg);   } </code></pre>   and my main which i use to test (main.cc)   <pre><code>#include  reallylongint.h  #include &lt;iostream&gt;   using namespace std;   int main(int argc  char** argv){   string a =  56789 ;   long long b = 123456;     reallylongint x = reallylongint(a);   reallylongint y = reallylongint(b);   cout&lt;&lt; a:  &lt;&lt;x&lt;&lt;endl;   cout&lt;&lt; b:  &lt;&lt;y&lt;&lt;endl;   y.swap(x);    cout &lt;&lt; b after swapping with a:   &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt;endl;   } </code></pre>   i believe the problem lies in the value i pass to my swap call   <pre><code>y.swap(x) </code></pre>   but when i run the code the size of this->numdigits is junk  and i get a segfault because of this number interfering with my print function.,c++

with css  how to style a generic  global style   <strong>update</strong>: this question is about <strong>global</strong> style.  so solution such as <code>#some-id .score</code> is not a solution.    at first  i was styling as   <pre><code>.score { font-size: 32px; color: #777 } </code></pre>   and the  score  is something that can happen any where  something of a global style.  but since other style actually might have:   <pre><code>#summary-panel { font-size: 13px } </code></pre>   the one with <code>id</code> will override the one just having classes (the first css rule in this post).  (so if score is displayed within <code>summary-panel</code> then the <code>font-size</code> will be overridden to be <code>13px</code> but the <code>score</code> style is supposed to be global and need a <code>32px</code> style.) so i was tempted to use   <pre><code>.score { font-size: 32px !important; color: #777 !important } </code></pre>   because the <code>!important</code> can act as the  second level  which override everything ordinary  and act as a global style.    is this a good way or better way   one catch is that if sometimes we might have a css issue with ie 7 (or ie 6)  that we need a separate stylesheet such as <code>ie.css</code>  and in there  there might be also   <pre><code>#summary-panel { font-size: 12px !important } </code></pre>   so in this case  the <code>!important</code> will be overridden because the one having an <code>id</code> will always win over just classes.  so is there a better way,css

java: searching deleting and formatting in a text file  i am making a flight reservation system for my course project and i am having problems using stringbuilder which my teacher asked me to use in my code.    i wrote this method to delete a customer s data from a text file which i am using for storing the customer s details and the ticket number i assigned to them now this method takes the ticket number and searches in the text file and delete that entry (line of text file). the text file is formatted in this way   <pre><code>(name +  \t  + socialnum +  \t  + cellnum +  \t  + ticknum +  \n ) </code></pre>   the problem is that when i check the text file manually i see that the file was correctly formatted before but after running this method it is not.( the last escape sequence i.e  \n  is not being printed to the file).   <pre><code>public static void deletedata(string b) throws filenotfoundexception {     scanner input = new scanner(basic.file); // text file used as database     while (input.hasnext()) {         string a = input.nextline();         a = a.trim();         a = a.touppercase(locale.root);         if (a.contains(b)) {             continue;         }         basic.c.append(a).append( \n ); // c is stringbuilderobj      }     if ((basic.c.tostring()).equals(  )) {         system.out.println( invalid ticket number. );     } else {         try (printwriter out = new printwriter(basic.file)) {             string result = basic.c.tostring();             out.println(result);          }     } </code></pre>,java

variable at start of list not defined  i am having a problem with whatever variable is first in the list. for example  if the list began with a  it throws a nameerror  and when it starts with b  it too throws a name error. i am absolutely baffled by this and i would appreciate any insights.    note: this is a generalised version of my program as i wanted to keep it relevant to others. there are many variables in my full program  so that s why i am importing them separately (aesthetics).     the main program   <pre><code>import variables  variables = [a  b  c]  with open( /users/bendowling/user_input.txt    r ) as userinputfile:     userinput = userinputfile.read()     userinput = userinput.strip()     userinput = userinput.lower()  userinputfile = open( /users/bendowling/user_input.txt    w+ )  for vars in variables:     if vars in userinput:         userinputfile.write( %s   vars)  userinputfile.close() </code></pre>   the variables (i.e. variables.py)   <pre><code>a = [ something1    something2    something3 ]  b = [ something4    something5    something6 ]  c = [ something7    something8    something9 ] </code></pre>,python

xxpython comment multiple line not working in array  for example: i have   <pre><code>array = [\ 1  2  3  4 ] </code></pre>   i want to comment out 2 and 3 this works:   <pre><code>array = [\ 1  #2  #3  4 ] </code></pre>   this does not:   <pre><code>array = [\ 1      2  3      4 ] </code></pre>   now imagine that array is huge. hundreds of lines. i cannot find a easy way to do it unless use some editor trick. i cannot believe that python as a language does not have something that works for multiple lines of comment properly. again  the fact it does not have {} is way messed up than this. please point out how this should be done and that i m too stupid to find it with google.    -- edit 2 -- i agree with everyone that store data this way is not ideal. but i have some existing bad code. i need to deal quickly to figure out the problem. let s face it  we ve all been there unless you never worked in a real job. any other language i worked with before have syntax to block comment multiple lines that works anywhere in the code. don t anyone feel this is a problem for python,python

deployment of one .net page from a test to live server  i have been using .net for a couple of years. whenever i publish a web site (to a test server or live server on our network) i always tick  allow this precompiled site to be updateable  and  use fixed naming and single page assemblies .    looking at the files produced on the test server after publishing - i can see  for example  a page called customerdetails.aspx and  in the bin folder  a file called app_web_customerdetails.aspx.abcde7c2.dll    the files on the live server have exactly the same names.    i normally publish the whole site but i have a situation now with a hard to find bug that means i want to just update one page on the live server. after publishing a bug fix to the test server that seems to work  can i simply copy that page and its dll from the test server to the live server  will that single page simply work on the live server or does it have to published with the context of the whole site     sorry to ask such a daft question  but i find the documentation on this on microsoft s site not very clear.,asp.net

how can i imitate this view controller modal transition  so i m trying to imitate <a href= http://www.gfycat.com/drearybountifulcrow  rel= nofollow noreferrer >the transition found in the pocketcasts app</a>. the idea is to have a view controller emerge from the bottom of the screen when an item is clicked on  and the view controller can either be swiped up to go full screen or swiped downwards to dismiss it. i honestly have no idea how i would achieve this  so i m wondering if anyone has dealt with it before. ideally this would be done in swift  but obj-c works. thanks!,ios

python making custom overloaded operators  is there a simple way in python to make a custom overloaded operator (i am aware of the default ones).    an example of what i mean: say i am working on a vector class  and i want to do a vector cross product which i want to represent by the character x   there is no default overloaded operators that does this. (therefore  i would like to know if this is possible  as it is in c++ for example).    thanks,python

php write to file multiline  this is my first time touching php so what seems like it should be a simple task has been a fairly long project for me so far between the google searching and trial and error  but i m on the home stretch with one minor issue.    i m writing a form  essentially for case notes  so i can fill in the fields  hit submit  and it puts everything into the appropriate case note template  and writes it to a file to serve as a local backup so i don t have to do that manually.    now i have the following section on my form for case notes  which likely contain multiple lines  paragraphs  etc   <pre><code>case comments: &lt;br&gt; &lt;textarea name= comment  rows= 10  cols= 60 &gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; &lt;p align= right &gt;&lt;input type= submit  name= submit &gt;&lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>   then in the form output page  i have the following. after some searching i found that to get it to output  i ended up needing to add the nl2br() for the comments to retain the formatting   <pre><code>&lt; php $comment = nl2br($_post[ comment ]); echo $comment;  &gt;&lt;br&gt; </code></pre>   i then have the following to write it out to a file   <pre><code>$txt =  c:\path\to\casenotes.txt ; $fh = fopen($txt   a ); fwrite($fh $comment.php_eol); fclose($fh) </code></pre>   this writes everything out just fine  mostly. the problem is  the outputted test file ends up with html line break codes between the line breaks in the comments section  which is what i m trying to remove if at all possible now. this is what i m getting below   <pre><code>fsthyrew h&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; asdfsaf&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; asfd </code></pre>   maybe someone can help point me in the right direction here,php
injecting logic via controller to controller angularjs  i have 2 separate controllers (no relation) and one service shared between the two. in controllera  i have ng-click attribute on an element that is repeated  it is sending a true/false value to a function within the shared service.    when this function receives a call i want to increment or decrement an integer in controllerb based on the bit.    controllerb s integer should have no dependency on controllera  it receives an count from its own api currently this value is set to the ng-model attribute.    the controllers already share the service. i am unsure how to  inject  to controller b  and alter the value of ng-model.    also is the architecture incorrect   since at some point controllers interact should i force a parent child relationship  it is only going to be for a handful of scenarios this will need to happen.,angularjs
close the parent window without a ie prompt (javascript)  i am trying to close the parent window of a popup  but i get the confirmation box in the parent window. i know this is an ie security  feature  but it will be very annoying to my users. i am aware of the  fix  where you do this    window.open( link    toolbar=no menubar=... );  window.open(     _self     ); window.close();     the issue is that i want to close the parent window from the child window with a link. i know you can also set the parent of the window on the child  but that does not seem to work either. is there any fix out there to do this. thanks for the help.,javascript
managing software updates  i am looking into different ways to handle updating an asp.net application across many different clients  and looking for suggestions from your previous experience.    <ul> <li>we need the client apps to check if they have any available updates.</li> <li>a way to auto update (if possible  something similar to chromes but for webapp).</li> <li>some way to check that we are the ones sending the updates. (checksum of some sort i would guess)</li> <li>any other tips/advice</li> </ul>   thanks    edit: after thinking more about this overnight  i would have to agree that auto updates may not be the best. however maybe something more along the lines of how wordpress does it. wordpress will display saying that there is an update available then clicking will auto update the system.,asp.net
html injection question  using freetextbox  i m capturing html-formatted text. the purpose is to allow a website owner to update their web page content on a few pages. i have the system completed except for knowing what to do with the resultant html markup.    after the page editor completes their work  i can get the output from freetextbox  in html format  like so: <code>&lt;font color= #000080 &gt;&lt;b&gt;this is some text.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</code>    i tried storing it as escaped markup in web.config  but that didn t work since it kept hosing the tags even after i changed them to escaped characters  like so: <code>&amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;#000080&amp;quot;&amp;gt;</code>    the reason i wanted to store this kind of string as a key in web.config is that i could successfully store a static string  set a lebel s value to it  and successfully render the text. but when i try to escape it  it gets reformatted in web.config by .net somehow.    so i escaped all the characters  encoded them as base64 and stored that. then on page_load  i tried to decode it  but it just shows up as text  with all the html tags showing as well - it doesn t get rendered. i know a million people use this control  but i m damned if i can figure out how to do it right.    so here s my question: how can i inject the saved html into an edited page so it shows up in browsers like the editor wants it to look,asp.net
css height transition in presence of padding (not covered by existing answers)  [my question differs from the suggested duplicate because of the presence of padding in my animated div]    trying to get a div to expand  without having fixed heights and with some padding. my css is below and i toggle <code>.closed</code> in and out using jquery.   <pre><code>.slide {   padding: 10%;   background-color: gold;   overflow-y: hidden;   transition: height 2s;   transition: max-height 2s;   height: auto;   max-height: 1000px; }  .closed {   height: 0;   max-height: 0; } </code></pre>   the issue is that with the padding you can t hide the text to start with  and without a fixed height you don t get a transitioned css change. can anyone help - hope i don t need to do more with javascript     <strong>update</strong> i ve now got to:   <pre><code>.slide {   padding: 10%;   background-color: gold;   overflow-y: hidden;   transition: max-height 2s ease;   max-height: 500px; }  .closed {   max-height: 0;   padding: 0;   transition: all 2s ease; } </code></pre>   see <a href= http://plnkr.co/edit/gcxjjpjy1iey2v078w2f p=preview  rel= nofollow >plnkr</a>. the problem now is the padding on closing. in the case above it transitions out  and if i limit the transition in .closed to <code>max-height</code> then there is a jarring effect as it collapses just as the animation starts.,css
regular expression to check non-escaped charcters  many characters  like ellipses  quotation marks  long hyphens  apostraphes  superscript  and subscript will all be encoded incorrectly as boxes and strange text characters when we are submitting the web page.we need to make a regex expression which will check for these characters.    actully when we would submit things like quotation marks  or ellipses  or bullet points  they would show up as a big square on the web page  or they would be escaped out and be a string of control characters  like $&amp;&amp;$. so  we want to find or check for those squares  control sequences  and other strange unicode character types.    so we need  regular expression that check all these. or is there any other way or approach that we should follow.,c#

use the foreign key that a query selects to get data within the same query  i have this issue with a query i am trying to build. the idea is that i have 3 tables where two have foreign keys. i want to make a query that selects the foreign key from table a and uses the same key to get data from key b.     so it will look like this:   <pre><code>select      id  foreignkey1  from      tablea      (select id from tableb where id = foreignkey1); </code></pre>   but somehow i am not able to do this or find any good documentation about it.,sql

performance cost of adding to the string prototype in javascript  i was looking at some code (<a href= https://github.com/einaros/tinycolor/blob/master/tinycolor.js  rel= nofollow >https://github.com/einaros/tinycolor/blob/master/tinycolor.js</a>) that adds to the prototype of the <code>string</code> object in javascript.     i was wondering how to assume the overhead of adding to the <code>string</code> prototype  as it applies to any string handling (cpu  memory) that doesn t require these additions. that s because i probably wouldn t find it useful to get overhead for all string manipulations just for this small shim  and i guess it s also a good time to get more friendly with javascript prototype manipulation of the native types.     as the topic has been endlessly discussed in various contexts  any pointer to an existing good or simple analysis would be helpful  or a succinct-yet-correct explanation. it s a bit hard to land using a google keyword search..    thanks!,javascript
memory optimization in huge data set  deal all  i have implemented some functions and like to ask some basic thing as i do not have a sound fundamental knowledge on c++. i hope  you all would be kind enough to tell me what should be the good way as i can learn from you. (please  this is not a homework and i donot have any experts arround me to ask this)    what i did is; i read the input x y z  point data (around 3gb data set) from a file and then compute one single value for each point and store inside a vector (result). then  it will be used in next loop. and then  that vector will not be used anymore and i need to get that memory as it contains huge data set. i think i can do this in two ways.  (1) by just initializing a vector and later by erasing it (see code-1). (2) by allocating a dynamic memory and then later de-allocating it (see code-2). i heard this de-allocation is inefficient as de-allocation again cost memory or maybe i misunderstood.    q1) i would like to know what would be the optimized way in terms of memory and efficiency.    q2) also  i would like to know whether function return by reference is a good way of giving output.

c programming percentage help 2 dice programn rolled 10000 times  starting from scratch  repeat part 4  with 2 dice.   let’s use 10 000 this time instead of 1000.    each die can be from 1 - 6  so the total of 2 dice must be in the range 2 – 12.    your output will be in the range of 2 – 12.      notice that it is much less likely to roll a 2 than it is to roll a 7  since a 2 can only be rolled a  1 + 1.  but a 7 can be 6 + 1  5 + 2  4 + 3  3 + 4  2 + 5  1 + 6.    count how many times each value occurs and output that count as in the previous part.    calculate what percentage of the time you roll a 2  3  4  etc. up to 12.  output the percentages with an accuracy of one place past the decimal.  post the results of this one on the discussion board.      my question is in my program i wrote it so that it outputs the amount rolled. i m having extreme problems trying to use a percentage formula to output the % of the rolled dice.     here is my code so far.   <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;time.h&gt; #define size 11 #define total 10000   int main(void)   {      int cnt = 0;     int die1  die2  sum;     int array[size];     srand(time(null));      for (cnt = 0; cnt &lt; size; cnt++)         array[cnt] = 0;      for (cnt = 0; cnt &lt; total; cnt++)     {         die1 = rand() % 6 + 1;         die2 = rand() % 6 + 1;         sum = die1 + die2;         ++array[sum-2];     }     for (cnt = 0; cnt &lt; size; cnt++)         printf( number of %d s: %d\n   cnt+2  array[cnt]);     system( pause ); } </code></pre>,c

c++ convert wwn string to data type recognized as hex  a project i am working on already has the wwn of a iscsi device stored as a std::string less the colons.  i have to grab a subset of the string and xor them as if they were bytes with another set of bytes for a scsi command security code.  which data type should i be converting the characters too so that the xor treats them as hex bytes.  the numbers are already exactly what i need but the compiler is going to interpret them as ascii.  i just need a way to tell the compiler these are already hex bytes.    the string is 601ad142 so i need to convert it too [0x60  0x1a  0xd1  0x42] so i can xor each byte with [0x57  0x68  0x6f  0x61]    if i can convert the wwn string: <code>600601601ad14200b9265b5b274efb84</code> (already provided in the existingcode) to a uinit64_t i can work with that too but:   <pre><code>std::string wwid(path.wwid); wwid.erase(std::remove(wwid.begin()  wwid.end()   : )  wwid.end());//remove colons uint64_t wwn = wwid std::istringstream strwwid(wwid); strwwid &gt;&gt; wwn; </code></pre>   return <code>0x23cc7401</code>    <strong>update</strong>: i found a working solution.   <pre><code>std::string wwid(path.wwid); wwid.erase(std::remove(wwid.begin()  wwid.end()   : )  wwid.end()); char wwnbytes[8]; strncpy( wwnbytes  wwid.c_str() + 6  8); // get chars for bytes 4 -7 std::string bytes = wwnbytes; std::stringstream ss; unsigned int secbytes; ss &lt;&lt; std::hex &lt;&lt; bytes; ss &gt;&gt; secbytes;  </code></pre>,c++
best practices for controlling access to form fields  i have a classic 3-tier asp.net 3.5 web application with forms that display business objects and allow them to be edited. controls on the form correspond to a property of the underlying business object. the user will have read/write  readonly  or no access to the various controls depending on his/her role. very conventional stuff.    my question is: what is the object-oriented best practice for coding this  is there anything more elegant than wrapping each control in a test for the user s role and setting its visible and enabled properties     thanks,asp.net

ios app submission without @3x images and build with xcode 6.1  i am planning to submit an ios app to appstore. i developed this app earlier with xcode5.1 which supports ios 6.0 and later(ios8 was not released that time).    do i want to restructure my app for ios 8.0 by including launch screen and icon images for iphone 6 and 6 plus.  (when i add @3x launch images for iphone6/6 plus its showing some alignment issues with my screens which will force me to postpone my release.)    will my app get rejected if i build the app with xcode 6.1 without including launch screen and icon images for iphone 6 and 6 plus.,ios
how to delete a row from an uitableview and insert it in a second uitableview in iphone   i have developed a program in iphone which manage cards  the main functionality is create cards (question  answer) and show them in a uitableview (this so far is working properly). each card have two buttons namely: ok-false  my idea is that when the user click on ok button  this card will appear in a new uitableview2 and deleted from the uitableview1(i do not know how to do it). in advance i add a new attribute to my card table in sqlite namely counter which will increase anytime that the user click on ok  with the idea behind that when the counter increase then will perform the function that i need  delete from current uitableview and insert in new uitableview  if the user click false  then the card will be deleted from tableview2 and inserted in tableview1. i will appreciate any ideas folks.    thanks!,iphone

computing stirling s approximation of user input python  i m a massive python noob and have been tasked with      write a program that computes n factorial using stirling’s approximation. your program should prompt the user to input a value for n and should then compute the stirling approximation for n! and output “the approximation is xxx which is yy of the exact answer” where xxx is the stirling approximation and yy is xxx/n!. (the value of yy should be close to 1 if the approximation is good.)     i wrote   <pre><code>import math  n = input(int( enter a value for n:  )  xxx = math.sqrt(2*math.pi*n)*(n/math.e)**n yy = xxx/n            print( the approximation is xxx which is yy of the exact answer ) </code></pre>   this is probably completely wrong  whats a simple way to do it,python

storing data in appstate and session  in my appstart.cshtml i fetch some data from the database  do calculations  serialize/deserialize json strings and such  etc  and i store the result in a couple appstate-variables by doing something like the following:(c#)   <pre><code>appstate[ myvar1 ]= astring ; appstate[ myvar2 ]=anarray; </code></pre>   these variables are accessed frequently and are a bit heavy to define so i thought something like this would make sense rather than creating the data from scratch every time it s needed. even if the optimization isn t needed it still makes sense to me since it also increases readability and definitely maintainability by not having the same code in a bunch of places where that data is needed.    likewise  i do similar actions on a per-user basis by putting data in session whenver a user logs in  e.g.   <pre><code>session[ uservar1 ]= mystring ; session[ uservar2 ]=myaray; </code></pre>   however  i ve just read that we should never rely on that the data stored in these still exist when we want to read them because they re stored in the server-memory which might have been cleared. is this true  so when we want to access one of these we should first check whether it s null or not  and if we re lucky it s not null and we can use it straight away  otherwise we set it again. is this how data stored in appstate and session are supposed to be used  and if so  what would be a good way of re-setting them if they re null  i suppose doing something like creating a function which sets them if they re null,asp.net

true nil in select options  is there any way of including <code>nil</code> in the options for <code>select</code>  i tried the <code>include_blank</code> option as shown below:   <pre><code>&lt;%= select(:object  :method  {select_options}  {include_blank: t(:none)}}) %&gt; </code></pre>   however  that does literally what it s named  adds a blank string which is not the same as <code>nil</code>. i ve tried also adding a nil option to select like this:   <pre><code>&lt;%= select(:object :method  {t(:none) =&gt; nil  select_options} %&gt; </code></pre>   but that gives same result as above.    of course i can handle this case in the controller but it seems very clumsy  how can i get a simple <code>nil</code> value in the select options,ruby-on-rails
how does this mysql query works   i m trying to understand how mysql queries work with and without group by.     imagine i have a table of film_actors  where each actor_id has a corresponding film_id. so the same actor participates in n different movies.    i want to select the actors that participate 20 movies:   <pre><code>select actor_id from film_actor group by actor_id having count(film_id) = 20; </code></pre>   this query works and returns the actor_ids that participate in 20 movies. but what if i just did:   <pre><code>select actor_id from film_actor having count(film_id) = 20; </code></pre>   why does this query only returns values if i equal it to the size of film_actor table (5463):   <pre><code>select actor_id from film_actor having count(film_id) = 5463; </code></pre>   in this case it returns me actor_id = 1. why  is it selecting film_ids without considering the corresponding actor_ids,mysql

is assigning a list<int> to ienumerable<int> beneficial or not   the language i use is c#.    say that a method of an object returns a <code>list&lt;int&gt;</code>. if we assign this result to a variable of type <code>ienumerable&lt;int&gt;</code> would we benefit anything or not     in other words   <pre><code>ienumerable&lt;int&gt; result = list </code></pre>   is better than     <code>list&lt;int&gt; result = list</code>     where <code>list</code> is a <code>list&lt;int&gt;</code>.    i think intuitively that we will not benefit anything. however  i would like to be sure. hence i am asking this.,c#

testing httpwebrequest/httpwebresponse client code  we have reasonably complex http client application here. using tdd proved to be pretty difficult.    we started by using simple interface:   <pre><code>public interface ihttp {     textreader requestandopentextreader(         uri uri  string method  textreader body = null);     webheadercollection requestandgetheaders(         uri uri  string method  textreader body = null);     void request(uri uri  string method  textreader body = null); } </code></pre>   however application requires more and more exposure into details of http and continuing to evolve abovementioned interface seems to be a bit redundant.    so goes question. is there any convenient and standard way to mock out httpwebrequest/httpwebresponse without using profiler api based mocking framework      or some alternative open source implementation of client http api,.net

what s the role of assemblyfileversionattribute   i don t know what is the concrete purpose of the assemblyfileversion attribute. i know that assemblyversion is part of the strong name  which is the 4-pla (assembly name  assembly version  culture  public key token)  but i have no idea on how correctly use the assembly*<strong>file</strong>*version.    i currently use the buildversionincrement plugin in visual studio to increment the assemblyversion s revision number at each compilation and i m currently at 2.2.0.0 version (i reset the revision when upgrading minor revision)  <em>but i currently align assemblyfileversion with major and minor revision</em>  so that s now 2.2   <h1>my question is</h1>   what s the best practice of assemblyfileversion s value  what does that attribute affect in versioning  what if i won t change the value any more while i release newer versions of my assembly with up-to-date assemblyversion     thank you in advance,.net

getting started in c  i know there are many tutorials out there for getting started in c. however its hard for me to apply the knowledge. the way i ve always started out in languages is by writing scripts. of course c is not a scripting language.     my question isn t so much about learning c as much as it is about how to get started applying c. great i can write a temperature converter or a text-based rpg. maybe its because in python i just write up the code in somefile.py and chmod +x somefile.py &amp;&amp; somefile.py .  i do not really have an equivalent process for c. every time i read about c its a different compiling process with different flags. can someone just give me some definite direction on best ways to apply c when you already work with higher-level dynamic scripting languages      btw. .. i m asking about c and not c++.     i usually am on either opensuse 11 or ubuntu 9.04 .  what compiler do i use  is part of the problem. in python there is no choice its just  python somefile.py  same with php or ruby. i didn t know there were choices.,c
acknowledge multiple parallel.foreach loop  i have around 450k records in the database on which i have to make a fuzzy match. i have implemented the <code>parallel.foreach</code> loop to see if incoming request is matching with any of the 450k records. if during the search i found any match  i stop the <code>foreach</code> loop and give response back to caller with true (it says that match has been found).    i am calling database and store all the 450k records in static object (in memory). the logic for <code>parallel.foreach</code> is working good. the problem is that it takes almost 40-45 seconds to determine whether it is match or not.    i am planning to run multiple <code>parallel.foreach</code> for 100k data on each loop so that overall time is reduced. my challenge is how would i stop the execution of other <code>parallel.foreach</code> loops once i get match on one <code>parrallel.foreach</code>     below is my code for a single <code>parallel.foreach</code>:   <pre><code>public bool checkmatch(checkrequest request)     {         bool ispccmatch = false;

call an objective-c function non-virtually  is it possible to force objective-c to call a specific instance of a virtual method  rather than going through the standard virtual message dispatch  i know this is generally a bad idea  but i d like to know how to do it using the objective-c runtime.    for example  given class a and b that implement -(void) foo  where b is a subclass of a  i d like to call the foo method on a with the b instance (even though b would normally handle this message).    i know that i can make this happen by moving the guts of a s foo method to a new method and delegating to it  but i d like to figure out some way to do this through the objective-c runtime.    note: for the purposes of this question  assume that i can t change the source of a or b and i ve carefully weighed the risks of breaking encapsulation.,objective-c

reusable forms in angular  so i have a form that s basically the same in many different instances  except the names of the inputs may vary  and the data the form represents will be different.    i got a good start on reusable snippets from <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12698796/is-it-possible-to-do-reusable-snippets-within-angular-templates >this post</a>  but i want to expand on that  and figure out how to make it more dynamic.    <strong>html</strong>   <pre><code>&lt;script type= text/ng-template  id= mysnippet &gt;    &lt;form&gt;     {{mysinppet.firstthing}}&lt;input id= first-input /&gt;     {{mysinppet.secondthing}}&lt;input id= second-input /&gt;   &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/script&gt;  &lt;ng-include src=  mysnippet   ng-model= thingone &gt;&lt;/ng-include&gt; &lt;ng-include src=  mysnippet   ng-model= thingtwo &gt;&lt;/ng-include&gt; </code></pre>   <strong>js</strong>   <pre><code>$scope.thingone={   firstthing:  1     secondthing:  2     foo: src[ first-input ]    bar: src[ second-input ]  }; $scope.thingtwo={   firstthing:  3     secondthing:  4     first: src[ first-input ]    second: src[ second-input ]  }; </code></pre>   here s the plunker for this code (which obviously doesn t work): <a href= https://plnkr.co/edit/icoiq88e7gssyae92b0t p=preview  rel= nofollow noreferrer >https://plnkr.co/edit/icoiq88e7gssyae92b0t p=preview</a>    so how do i set up the snippet/ng-includes to allow communication with a model,angularjs
complicated ios multitouch interaction - any suggestions   i have subclassed a uiview that already handles single touches and drags. i want to enhance the interaction of this view so that  while dragging  if the user touches with a second finger (anywhere else in the view)  then the system prints a message. i ve made a stab at the code:    in my header file i ve declared:   <pre><code>nsstring *key; // this unique key identifies the first touch </code></pre>   my .m file i have:   <pre><code>- (void)touchesbegan:(nsset *)touches withevent:(uievent *)event  {      for (uitouch *t in touches) {         if (key == null)         {             key = [[[nsvalue valuewithpointer:t] description] copy];         }         if ([key isequaltostring:[[nsvalue valuewithpointer:t] description]])         {             nslog(@ calling parent to handle single touch );             [super touchesbegan:[nsset setwithobject:t] withevent:event];         }         else         {             [self twotouchdetected];         }     } }  -(void) touchesmoved:(nsset *)touches withevent:(uievent *)event {     for (uitouch *t in touches) {         if ([key isequaltostring:[[nsvalue valuewithpointer:t] description]])         {             [super touchesmoved:[nsset setwithobject:t] withevent:event];         }     } }  -(void) touchesended:(nsset *)touches withevent:(uievent *)event {     for (uitouch *t in touches) {         if ([key isequaltostring:[[nsvalue valuewithpointer:t] description]])         {             [super touchesended:[nsset setwithobject:t] withevent:event];             key = null;         }     } } </code></pre>   unfortunately there are issues with this implementation. the first time (while dragging with one finger) if i touch with the second figer  the system will register it immediately. however  the second time i touch with a second finger (while still continuing to drag with the first finger)  the second finger touch does not register until the first finger is lifted up. the events from the second finger are backed up...    what is also strange is that sometimes  the parent gets called with touch data from the 2nd finger and not the 1st.,ios
converting to column major fashion with two dimensional array  i am trying to load my matrix so that consecutive numbers will go down the columns using pointer/addressing methods.  currently my program prints the consecutive numbers across the rows.    <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;  int main() { int i j; int twodarray[5][5]  *twodarrayptr;   int add = 0;  for(i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {     for(j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++)     {            twodarray[i][j]= (i*5) + j;      }  }  twodarrayptr = &amp;(twodarray[0][0]);  for(i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {     for(j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++)     {         printf( %d    *(twodarrayptr +((i*5)+j)));       }     printf(  \n );  } } </code></pre>,c
html title is not centered  i am working on html code. i need the title of code be in center of page. the title of page (heading) contain 10 words.     the options i am using start the sentence from middle and then move to right. i need the whole .    <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt; &lt;html lang= en &gt;  &lt;head&gt;   &lt;meta charset= utf-8 &gt;    &lt;style type= text/css &gt;     .titleline {       position: absolute;       left: 50%;       width: 546px;       height: 74px;       font-family: timesnewromanpsmt;       font-size: 35px;       line-height: 1.06;       color: #222222;     }   &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;   &lt;table&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;       &lt;center class= titleline &gt;you are one step closer to &lt;br/&gt;the experience of a life time&lt;/center&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;/table&gt;   &lt;/body&gt;  &lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>   you see the sentence start at center but moves to right.     can this be fixed somehow.,html
update one database with info from another  i have this query   <pre><code>select pu.payroleid  u.userid  u.firstname  u.lastname from users as u  payrole_users as pu where pu.firstname = u.firstname and pu.lastname = u.lastname limit 0   60 </code></pre>   which selects all <code>userid</code> s from the <code>users</code> table if the names matches the names in the <code>payrole_users</code> table (if i ve got the query right!). what i need is: for each <code>userid</code>  i need to update the <code>payrole_users.intranetid</code> field. is this possible to do with just one query or would i need to store all these as an array and then loop through the array after and then update it,mysql
mocking and testing an angular resource and function in a directive test using jasmine  i m going through the process of refactoring my controller function into more streamlined ones in my directives.    am reasonably new to angular and am running into problems mocking and testing my promises within the directives.    within the function  i call a box.reboot() from the directive rebootbox.   <pre><code>app.directive( rebootbox   [ box   function(box) {   return {     restrict:  a       link: function( scope  element  attrs ) {       element.bind(  click   function() {         box.reboot({id: scope.box.slug}).$promise.then(function(results) {           scope.box.state =  rebooting ;         }  function(errors) {           scope.box.errors = true;         })       });     }   } }]) </code></pre>   my tests pass in the controller specs because i am able to do something like this:   <pre><code>fakefactory = {   reboot: function () {     deferred = q.defer();     return {$promise: deferred.promise};   }     ... }  mainctrl = $controller( mainctrl   {   $scope: scope    box: fakefactory  }); </code></pre>   however  i can t get my head around how i am supposed to do this in my directive test     i ve tried this but i don t understand how i can mock what i did in the controller  ie:   <pre><code>box: fakefactory </code></pre>   my directive test looks like this so far:   <pre><code>describe( box reboot   function () {    var $scope        element        deferred        q        boxfactory;    beforeeach(module( myapp ));    beforeeach(inject(function($compile  $rootscope  $q) {     $scope = $rootscope;     q = $q;     element = angular.element( &lt;div reboot-box&gt;&lt;/div&gt; );     $compile(element)($rootscope)      boxfactory = {       reboot: function () {         deferred = q.defer();         return {$promise: deferred.promise};       }     };    }))    it( should reboot a box   function() {     spyon(boxfactory   reboot ).andcallthrough()      $scope.box = {}     element.click();      deferred.resolve({slug: 123});     $scope.$apply()      expect(boxfactory.reboot).tohavebeencalled();    });   ... </code></pre>   obvs. it fails because i m spying on boxfactory.    what is the best way to go about testing such a function     --- edit ----    further to the comment below  i ve used $provide to mock the service call:   <pre><code>  beforeeach(module( myapp   function($provide) {     boxfactory = {       get: function () {         deferred = q.defer();         return {$promise: deferred.promise};       }        reboot: function () {         deferred = q.defer();         return {$promise: deferred.promise};       }      };     $provide.value( box   boxfactory); </code></pre>   i can now call deferred.resolve successfully and all my tests pass bar one.   <pre><code>expect(boxfactory.reboot).tohavebeencalled(); </code></pre>   is there a specific reason why this fails and how can i get it to pass,angularjs

when will microsoft end mainstream support for existing versions of the .net framework   i m wondering until when the .net framework 2.0  3.0  3.5 will be supported by microsoft.    according to <a href= http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/  rel= noreferrer >microsoft support lifetime page</a> for developer products  the mainstream support phase should last for 5 years and extended support phase for another 5 years.    i found a <a href= http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/ p1=8291  rel= noreferrer >.net framework 2.0 entry</a> in the <a href= http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifeselectindex  rel= noreferrer >support lifetime index</a>  however i was unable to find any entry for .net 3.0 and .net 3.5 there (or .net 4.0).    according to the .net framework 2.0 entry <strong>mainstream support phase for .net 2.0 will end at 4/12/2011</strong>.    i have two questions:   <ul> <li> considering that .net 3.0 and .net 3.5 are dependent on .net 2.0 clr does mainstream support for .net 3.x also end in 4/12/2011   </li> <li> if not  when is the end of mainstream support for .net 3.0 and .net 3.5  </li> </ul>,.net

some basic thinking regarding flow of code. to create or not to create new variables  i m a beginner c# programmer and i m curious which of the variants from bellow it s better from the point of view of the compiler and so on.    variant 1   <pre><code>string file =  20071201.22002300.wmv ; //name of the file is yyyymmdd.hhmmhhmm.wmv string[] tmp= file.split( . ); datetime startdate= new datetime(convert.toint32(tmp[0].substring(0  4))                                   convert.toint32(tmp[0].substring(4  2))                                    convert.toint32(tmp[0].substring(6  2))                                    convert.toint32(tmp[1].substring(0  2))                                    convert.toint32(tmp[1].substring(2  2))  0);  datetime enddate =new datetime(convert.toint32(tmp[0].substring(0  4))                                  convert.toint32(tmp[0].substring(4  2))                                  convert.toint32(tmp[0].substring(6  2))                                  convert.toint32(tmp[1].substring(4  2))                                 convert.toint32(tmp[1].substring(6  2))  0); </code></pre>   variant 2   <pre><code>string file =  20071201.22002300.wmv ; //name of the file is yyyymmdd.hhmmhhmm.wmv string[] tmp= file.split( . ); int year = convert.toint32(tmp[0].substring(0  4)); int month= convert.toint32(tmp[0].substring(4  2)); int day = convert.toint32(tmp[0].substring(6  2)); int hour = convert.toint32(tmp[1].substring(0  2)); int minute = convert.toint32(tmp[1].substring(2  2)); int endhour= convert.toint32(tmp[1].substring(4  2)); int endminute = convert.toint32(tmp[1].substring(6  2)); datetime startdate= new datetime(year  month  day  hour  minute  0); datetime startdate= new datetime(year  month  day  endhour  endminute  0); </code></pre>   generally i prefer to work as in first variant because i m not working as a programmer so i don t work together with other programmers  i m just creating tools to help in my job   and also i consider that the first variant it s easier for the compiler.    please correct if i m wrong and thanks in advance,c#

real time notifications on ios  i am developing an ios app which needs to receive regular data from the server at specific period of time (every 5 seconds).    apple gives developers some choices for background working.    i convinced that <code>background fetch</code> is the proper method for my problem. but when i tested it i got confused. <code>background fetch</code> has many issues with my requirements:   <ol> <li> it does not fetch data at period you defined when declared it: <code>application.setminimumbackgroundfetchinterval(uiapplicationbackgroundfetchintervalminimum)</code> i tried this and this: <code>application.setminimumbackgroundfetchinterval(5)</code>. but no guarantee that your app will fetch data at this interval. </li> <li> when the screen is off  your app will not make any fetch until the     phone is unlocked again. </li> </ol>   i wonder if there is a way that let my app receives real time data (or at least every 5 seconds).    <strong>note:</strong> i read about <code>remote notifications</code> and i do not guarantee that i can execute it now  so i am searching for other solutions.    thanks,ios

setprop doesn t set the property on rooted android phone  i m developing an application (using eclipse + android sdk/ndk) which uses the micro-usb port on an android phone to connect to peripherals.  i am trying to connect to the adb daemon on the phone via wifi (tcp port 5555) so i can debug my application in eclipse.  however  i just can t get this to work.      nothing i try actually results in the adb daemon on the phone switching to tcpip mode (as far as i can tell by looking at the output of <code>getprop</code>).  the issue seems to be that i can t set the relevant <code>service.adb.tcp.port</code> property on the phone.  the development phone i am using is an lg gt540 running cyanogenmod 7.0.0 (android v2.3.3).  development machine is imac running os x lion.    here is some relevant information on what i have tried/confirmed/discovered:   <ul> <li>the phone is rooted (<code>ru.secure = 0</code>)</li> <li>connecting to adb via usb works fine</li> <li>the adb service on the mac is running as root (<code>adb root</code>)</li> <li><code>adb shell</code> gives me a shell with super-user access (# prompt  su  ability to edit system files etc)</li> <li><code>adb tcpip 5555</code> does not complain or throw errors when run from a terminal window on the mac but does not set the <code>service.adb.tcp.port</code> property on the phone</li> <li><code>setprop service.adb.tcp.port 5555</code> entered at the # prompt of a terminal window on the phone does not complain or throw errors but does not set the <code>service.adb.tcp.port</code> property </li> <li><code>setprop persist.service.adb.enable 0</code> works from both mac and phone shells (confirmed by checking adb daemon stops and <code>getprop</code> returns 0 for the enable property)</li> <li><code>setprop persist.service.adb.enable 1</code> works fine from both mac and phone shells (confirmed by checking adb daemon starts and <code>getprop</code> returns 1 for enable property)</li> <li>the only properties on the phone relating to adb on the phone are <code>persist.service.adb.enable</code> and <code>init.svc.adbd</code> (if adb is running)(confirmed by <code>getprop | grep adb</code> on the phone)</li> <li>apps on the market that purport to  automatically  configure adb for wifi (such as <a href= http://www.appbrain.com/app/wifi-adb/com.ttxapps.wifiadb  rel= nofollow >wifi adb</a>) do not work either (<code>tcp.port</code> property is not set and adb over tcp does not work)</li> </ul>   am i looking too hard here and missing something obvious   there are many posts and articles on the internet relating to problems getting adb to work over tcp but they all relate to phone rooting issues.    is anyone able to shed some light on why i can t seem to set this particular property or suggest any other issue that may be preventing the adb daemon from running in tcpip mode,android

sending a pointer to a pointer by reference  i have been trying to send a pointer to a pointer (we can call it an array of strings  or an array of an array of chars even) to a function  by reference  because i need it to be updated. i don t want to have the function returning the pointer to a pointer (that one i got working) because i want the return to be the size of the array.    this is a working function i created for testing purposes  which returns the pointer to a pointer  and the calling method:   <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  char **populate_items() {         char **items;         int i;         items = (char **) malloc(sizeof(char*) * 3);         for (i=0; i&lt;3; i++)                 *(items+i) = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char) * 10);         items[0] =  1234567890 ;         items[1] =  2345678901 ;         items[2] =  3456789012 ;         return items; }  int main(int argv  char *argc) {         char **items;         int i;         items = populate_items();         for(i=0; i&lt;3; i++)                 printf( %s\n   items[i]);         return 0; } </code></pre>   this is what i think the function and the call to the function that gets the pointer to a pointer as reference should look like  but i get a segmentation fault when trying to print items[1] or items[2]   <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  populate_items(char ***items) {         int i;         *items = (char **) malloc(sizeof(char*) * 3);         for (i=0; i&lt;3; i++)                 *(items+i) = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char) * 10);         *items[0] =  1234567890 ;         *items[1] =  2345678901 ;         *items[2] =  3456789012 ; }  int main(int argv  char *argc) {         char **items;         int i;         populate_items(&amp;items);         for(i=0; i&lt;3; i++)                 printf( %s\n   items[i]);         return 0; } </code></pre>   in the abstraction that i created in my head  the function should be fine  but off course it s not given that i m getting a segmentation fault. i already managed to understand how a pointer to a pointer works just fine  but i think i m having trouble putting my head over how the pointer to a pointer to a pointer concept translates into code.    so what am i missing,c
company s app distribution to the company s customers  i would like to distribute an application where only registered and paying customers of our company can have access to. the app would be distributed in the app store for free and users would have to log in with the registered details to use the application.     the problem is that the app will have certain amount of functionality based on what the registered customers have paid us. for example customer a paid us $500 for the registration and hence he will have the full functionality of this application. on the other hand customer b paid us $250 and this customer will only have half of the functionality of this application.     is my company allowed to do this,iphone

how to warn about discarding changes with angularjs  <strong>background:</strong> i am using angularjs.  i plan to have a user dialog warning before closing the browser window if any changes were made  i.e.   you have unsaved changes.  changes will be lost.  continue      <strong>question:</strong> in angularjs  how would i monitor for any change to any model  i.e.  so that i could set a flag like <code>var pagewasmodified = true;</code>    in other words  i want to know if any model in the entire angular system has been touched.  surely i shouldn t have to register a watch for each of my models...,angularjs
how to turn gif image into lightweight uiimage   i m working on gif viewer but i have a problem with thumbnail images. they are not animated  but when i set huge gif as image to imageview it still takes a lot of time and interface lags.    here is my method how i do this:   <pre><code>-(uicollectionviewcell *)collectionview:(uicollectionview *)collectionview                  cellforitematindexpath:(nsindexpath *)indexpath     {         mycell *mycell = [collectionview                                         dequeuereusablecellwithreuseidentifier:@ cell                                          forindexpath:indexpath];         uiimage *image;          nsdata *data = [nsdata datawithcontentsofurl:self.datasource[indexpath.row]];         image = [uiimage imagewithdata:data];          mycell.myimageview.image = image;          return mycell;     } </code></pre>   url is local and as i have found out the bottleneck here is that setting huge gifs (few megabytes each) as uiimage is expensive and takes time.    how do i optimize this  i want to create lightweight thumbnail non animated images from the image gif data i have. how do i go about this     edit: actually i have implemented cache to store them  but this is not ideal solution since i have to clear cache occasionally with memory warnings. my question is still valid. here is the code i have for now:   <pre><code>-(uicollectionviewcell *)collectionview:(uicollectionview *)collectionview                  cellforitematindexpath:(nsindexpath *)indexpath {     mycell *mycell = [collectionview                                     dequeuereusablecellwithreuseidentifier:@ cell                                      forindexpath:indexpath];     uiimage *image;      if ([self.cache objectforkey:self.datasource[indexpath.row]]) {          image = [uiimage imagewithdata:[self.cache objectforkey:self.datasource[indexpath.row]]];      } else {          nsdata *data = [nsdata datawithcontentsofurl:self.datasource[indexpath.row]];         image = [uiimage imagewithdata:data];     }      mycell.myimageview.image = image;      return mycell; } </code></pre>,ios

getopt_long() -- proper way to use it   ok  i have searched and found the following two stackoverflow topics that started me in the right direction:    <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189972/argument-parsing-helpers-for-c-unix/ >argument-parsing helpers for c/unix</a>    <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/498320/pass-arguments-into-c-program-from-command-line >pass arguments into c program from command line</a>    note: all code is pseudo-code. will post compilable code when it works.    however  i m still completely confused on how to use getopt_long() in c. the program i m writing is defined as having the following possible tags (but can include as many as you absolutely need  filling the rest in with empty values):   <pre><code>id3taged filename -title  title  -artist  artist  -year 1991 -comment  comment  -album  album  -track 1 </code></pre>   now  from what i read  i need to utilize a struct for the long options  correct  if so  i wrote something along the lines of this:   <pre><code>struct fields field = {     char *[] title;     char *[] artist;     char *[] album;     int year;     char *[] comment;     int track; }   static struct options long_options[] = {     { title   0  &amp;field.title   t }      { artist   0  &amp;field.artist   a }      { album   0  &amp;field.album   b }      { year   0  &amp;field.year   y }      { comment   0  &amp;field.comment   c }      { track   0  &amp;field.track   u }      {0  0  0  0} } </code></pre>   now  from what i gathered  i would be calling it via this:   <pre><code>int option_index = 0;  int values = getopt_long(argc  argv   tabycu   long_options  &amp;option_index); </code></pre>   from here  could i strictly use the field struct and do what i need to within my program  however  if this is the case  can someone explain the whole long_options struct  i read the man pages and such  and i m just utterly confused. by rereading the man pages  i can see i can set variables to null  and should be setting all my option requirements to  required_argument   and then setting the structs via a while() loop  however  i see optarg being used. is this set by getopt_long()  or is it missing from the example     and one last issue  i will always have an unnamed required option: filename  would i just use argv[0] to gain access to that  (since i can assume it ll be first).    on a side note  this is related to a homework problem  but it has nothing to do with fixing it  its more of a fundamental  have to understand argument passing and parsing in c via command line first.,c
creating a balancing class to balance weights  first of all i must admit that it is my assignment. but i am not asking anyone to solve it but i am working hard to solve it and need help with my algorithm.     i have an array of weights that is assigned to leftside and rightside of a scale. i need to balance the weights in right side and left side using the weights in the array.     i have the following code but it does not cover all the situations:    <pre><code>-(bool) isbalanced {     _weights = [nsmutablearray arraywitharray:@[@3 @4 @2 @1 @5 @6 @4]];      self.leftside =  [[_weights objectatindex:arc4random() % 7] integervalue]; // random weight     self.rightside = [[_weights objectatindex:arc4random() % 7] integervalue]; // random weight      if(self.leftside == self.rightside) return yes; // already balanced      if(self.leftside &gt; self.rightside)     {         // add weights on right side         int difference = self.leftside - self.rightside;         int index = [_weights indexofobject:[nsnumber numberwithint:difference]];         self.rightside += [[_weights objectatindex:index] integervalue];          nslog(@ %d  index);     }     else     {         int difference = self.rightside - self.leftside;         int index = [_weights indexofobject:[nsnumber numberwithint:difference]];         self.leftside += [[_weights objectatindex:index] integervalue];         nslog(@ %d  index);     }      return self.leftside == self.rightside; } </code></pre>   update:     to simplify! i have a number 6 and now i need to search inside an array of ints if any of the numbers can be added together to get 6. example:    <pre><code>1 2 3 5 4  </code></pre>   in the above array i can take 1+2+3 which makes 6. i can also take 4+2 which is 6. the question is how do i find those individual numbers that can sum up to the number 6.,objective-c
need help to disable download from a url  is there a way to disable a user from downloading a file from a url     for example i have a link:    wow.mywebsitedomain.com/templates/filename.svg    i want to disable the user from downloading the filename.svg    these svg files are not just an image  they are editable designs that i have spent countless hours on each. no  i do not care if someone does a screenprint or gets a png etc  as those are not scalable  editable  vector files.    when the user clicks on a png thumbnail my actual link opens my online design editor to allow the user to customize these files  then save to my server  then purchase printed media  and they are not allowed to download any files.    i tried putting the actual files into a password protected folder on my server  but they do not open properly  and i do not want the user to have password access to this folder.    essentially i need the link to be accessible  just not show the actual link for someone to copy and open/save/download etc.     hopefully there is a simple solution for a non-programmer with basic html skills     thanks,html

how to run a thread again in a thread or initialise that thread  basically i have the code   <pre><code>thread t1 = new thread(new runnable() {     public void run(){         if(close==true){             joptionpane.showmessagedialog(null ”ok”);         else{              t1.run();         }     } }); </code></pre>   but where it says t1.run it says variable t1 might not have been initialised. so is there another way to make the thread run again in that else place or is there a way to initialise it close is a boolean variable. thank you,java
working out an average on time  i m trying to find out the best way to do an average on time (basically call times i want to find out the average)    the data is coming from a datatable that i m looping through. i can t quite work out how to use a timespan though  what can i convert the string from / to to pass it through like i have below    <pre><code>timespan total = default(timespan);  foreach (datarow row in dtchats.rows) {     total += row[ totaltime ].tostring(); }  timespan myaverage = total / dtchats.rows.count; </code></pre>   edit:    sorry  row[ totaltime ] is a time value such as 0:05:44 representing 5mins 44 seconds,c#
calling the superclass  constuctor twice in the subclass  constructor  i have a user defined class  say a. i have another user defined class b which publicly extends a.    when i define the constructor of b  i have to call the constructor of a in the member initializer list of b s constructor  or else the compiler will call the default constructor.   <pre><code>class a {     int a; public:     a(int x = 0) {         a = x;     } };  class b : public a {     int b; public:     b(int x = 0) : a(2*x) {         b = x;     } }; </code></pre>   now  i understand the logic behind all this. however  what i want to know is what happens when i do this instead:   <pre><code>class a {     int a; public:     a(int x = 0) {         a = x;     } };  class b : public a {     int b; public:     b(int x = 0) {         a(2*x);         b = x;     } }; </code></pre>   i mean  we all know that the compiler will call the default constructor of a before it enters the body of the b s constructor. now  the first line of b s constructor body is to call another constructor of a (which takes arguments). so  what does this result in  two different  constructors of the superclass are getting called here whenever an object of the subclass is being created. please explain what happens...whether two objects will be created or what.,c++

dice roll simulation in java  i searched this site and found similar codes but a little different. for my lab in class the instructions say that i need to roll n die   m times and display the number of times a roll occurs in a frequency table. so i m having a bit of trouble setting up the data in my frequency table. the frequency table prints right but my numbers are wrong. i feel like i m missing something either and array or an increment  please help    my input:   <pre><code>import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; import java.util.*;  public class lab1 {     public static void main(string[] arg)   {        random ran = new random();        string n = joptionpane.showinputdialog(null  how many dice :  );        string m = joptionpane.showinputdialog(null  how many rolls :  );        int die = integer.parseint(n);        int roll = integer.parseint(m);        int count = 0;        int[] rollarr = new int[die*6+1];         for(int i=0;i&lt;rollarr.length;i++)        {             rollarr[i] = 0;        }         for( int i=0; i&lt;roll;i++)        {             count = die*1 + ran.nextint ( 6 );             ++rollarr[count];        }         for(int r=1;r&lt;rollarr.length;r++)             system.out.println(r +  :  + rollarr[r]);   } } </code></pre>   the example says to roll 4 dice 1 000 000 times to get a bell curve but my curve has alot of zeroes. my output:   <pre><code>1:0 2:0 3:0 4:166309 5:166424 6:166523 7:166984 8:167286 9:166474 10:0 11:0 12:0 13:0 14:0 15:0 16:0 17:0 18:0 19:0 20:0 21:0 22:0 23:0 24:0 </code></pre>,java

java interface - constants and static class in normal interface  consider following interface.   <pre><code>public interface thirdpartyapihandler {      public operationresult dooperation(operationinput input);      public static class operationresult {          //members of opeationresult. metrics after file processing          private int successfulrecords;          private int failedrecords;     }        public static class operationinput {          //implementations call third party api to process this file.          private string inputbatchfile;      }        //constant which would be same across all implementations.     public static final int global_constant = 1; } </code></pre>   is above interface a bad design    <ol> <li> <code>operationresult</code> and <code>operationinput</code> are defined as static class. they would be only used by implementations and not anywhere else. advantage that i see here is - i don t have to create separate files for these two classes. also they get namespace of parent class. </li> <li> i have read about constant interface. but in this case  i am defining constant in normal interface which are bound to be same across all implementations and would be used in those implementations. </li> </ol>   i am using this pattern for first time so wanted to get suggestions.,java

iphone vs website development times for website style app  i build websites for a living and have a very accurate way to cost them. i am being asked to price an iphone app for viewing real estate properties that is virtually a website on an iphone. i need to know roughly how much more/less it would take to build. here are the screens.    home page    view all houses (about 20)    click on house for details    view images  floor plans    add to favorites    the app is hard coded  nothing is downloaded from the internet.    there is nothing particularly  iphone-y  about the application - no complex visual interfaces  no gps functionality and so forth.    could someone give me a rough estimate as to how long these apps take to build compared to a website for an experienced developer  i am not talking about a newbie  someone whose has plenty of iphone experience.,iphone

stop background music when user closes the app  not when user changes activity  i m studying how to develop android app. i started with a very simple app with only one activity. then i added a service to play background music; of course i used the method onpause()  onstop() ondestroy() to manage the service.    but now  that i have another activity  the background music stops when the new activity is opened (because  the method onpause() is called).    i want to stop the background music only when user closes or destroys my entire app  not when user passes from an activity to another.     probably i made a big mistake when i started building my app. now i  m trying to solve this problem.    i tried to use also bindservice  but i still have the same problem.    how should i menage this issue,android

can i build this special rounding function with standard library components   is there  in c++ standard library  a way to obtain a <code>func</code> function with this behaviour :   <ul> <li>takes a double <code>num</code> as input;</li> <li>returns the highest integer <strong>strictly</strong> inferior to  <code>num</code>.</li> </ul>   i emphasize <em>strictly</em>  because if we read ‘inferior or equal’ then of course the <code>ceil</code> function will do the job.    what i want is : <code>func(3.1)</code> equals 3  <code>func(3.9)</code> equals 3  but most importantly <code>func(4)</code> equals 3 as well  and not 4. any good idea for implementation,c++
understanding release with nsmutabledata returning from a function  currently i m working on enhancing a project that has been developed by an external company for us. i m still in the learning phases of ios development  so want to make sure that i do things right at the beginning rather than hurt at the end of the project. i m running analyze on the project and getting a  potential leak of an object allocated on line 166 and stored into  commandtosend   from the following block of code.   <pre><code>-(nsdata*)getbusinesscodebase64:(nsstring*)strbusicode{     nsarray *tmp_arr = [strbusicode componentsseparatedbystring:@ - ];     nsmutabledata *commandtosend= [[nsmutabledata alloc] init];     unsigned char whole_byte;     char byte_chars[3] = { \0   \0   \0 };     int i;     for (i=0; i &lt; [tmp_arr count]; i++) {         byte_chars[0] = [[tmp_arr objectatindex:i] characteratindex:0];         byte_chars[1] = [[tmp_arr objectatindex:i] characteratindex:1];         whole_byte = strtol(byte_chars  null  16);         [commandtosend appendbytes:&amp;whole_byte length:1];      }     //nsdata *result = [nsdata datawithdata:commandtosend];     //[commandtosend release];     //return result;     return commandtosend; } </code></pre>   my investigating of this is that the call to this function wants an nsdata* to be returned. so i looked at doing     <pre><code>nsdata *result = [nsdata datawithdata:commandtosend]; [commandtosend release]; return result; </code></pre>   instead of the direct return of commandtosend.     is this the correct way of returning nsmutabledata objects without leaking or is there some other way that i should be doing this.,ios

how to get the type of data from a url  after implementing the basic version of simple downloader  i have spent a few hours googling to know how to get the type of my url say <em>.mp3 </em>.mp4 etc.for sites such as daily motion etc who s url don t have it appended at the end.this is because my downloader works for these types but a link without specific types makes it  to download a kb s file having nothing to play.    here is the code to determine the content-type to decide the *.extension for downloading:   <pre><code>     webclient mywebclient = new webclient();          string datastring = mywebclient.downloadstring( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1viyeu_pakistani-actress-meera-reema-saima-dance-on-faisal-ahmed-music-album-launch_news );         namevaluecollection headers = mywebclient.responseheaders;         foreach (string key in headers.allkeys)         {              console.writeline( header:{0} value:{1}   key  headers[key]);           } </code></pre>   it returned me a list of outputs on console among which a line was:    header:content-type value:text/html;charset=utf-8    now i want to hear that how will this help me to counter the issue already described.    suggestions please    here is the code for downloader   <pre><code>    private void downloadbtn_click(object sender  eventargs e)     {          webclient mywebclient = new webclient();          //declarations for string objects         string downloadurl  path;         //raw url taken from user        downloadurl =  this.downloadurl.text;         path = this.savepath.text;          uri tmp = new uri(downloadurl);        string endpathfilename = tmp.segments.last();        path = path + @ \  + endpathfilename;         //downloads file using async method         mywebclient.downloadfileasync(tmp  path);         downloadbtn.text =  download started ;        downloadbtn.enabled = false;         mywebclient.downloadprogresschanged += new downloadprogresschangedeventhandler(client_downloadprogresschanged);        mywebclient.downloadfilecompleted += new asynccompletedeventhandler(client_downloadfilecompleted);         } </code></pre>,c#

storing $scopes in a factory  i m adding features to a web application that i did not write myself.  i feel that a swipe feature cannot be added.    i saw somewhere  $scope cannot be accessed in a factory   but i somehow managed to store all scopes created by an ng-repeat in a factory. since javascript passes by value i m probably not  storing the scope  but still if i set the scopes ng-class within the factory i can clearly see the difference.  i thought it was a good idea since scope traversing is a pain. did i strike gold or am i wasting speed and space on storing the massive data which is scope     <strong>html</strong>    main.html   <pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller= somectrlwhichwasdeclaredalongtimeago &gt;     .     .     .      &lt;div class= items-container           ui-sortable= sortableoptions           ng-model= selectedsession.items &gt;         &lt;div ng-repeat= item in selectedsession.items               ng-controller= itemeditorctrl               ng-class= { item-last :$last} &gt;             &lt;div ng-if= item._value !== undefined                   class= item inline-comment &gt;                 &lt;span class= handle &gt;&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;             &lt;div ng-if= item._value === undefined                   class= item                   ng-include=  /views/item-editor.html  &gt;&lt;/div&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;          &lt;div class= stopper &gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   item-editor.html   <pre><code>&lt;div item-editor      swipe-function= swipeme       ng-swipe-left= swipeleft(item)        ng-swipe-right= swiperight(item) &gt;      ... &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   this will render a list with my magic code. if an item in list is clicked it will expand to full screen. you should be able to swipe between the items from there.    i don t think i have to post more than the html to explain the problem. i did manage to make the swipe happen with $rootscope.$broadcast but what if i have hundred items in my list  will it not grow slower with more and more items receiving message and processing them  i d rather just load all of the scopes into one factory on selection of this session and then get rid of it when a session is deselected. it might need some time to start but it doesn t take 5 minutes to swipe.,angularjs

pull column fields into another table as new rows  i m stumbling on this one  hopefully its easy and i m looking at it wrong.    i m receiving formatted xls files.  have a c# app that processes the data and does an sqlbulkcopy insert to my table.  there are 5 pairs of columns  one is a url text description and one a url itself.  these urls will reference an html or pdf file i will pull later into a second separate table.    leaving out unrelated fields  i have a table <strong>[base]</strong> with fields:<br>   <blockquote>    [id] (identity)<br> [baseid]<br> ...a bunch of other related fields    then...<br> [linktext1]<br> [linkurl1]<br> [linktext2]<br>   [linkurl2]<br> [linktext3]<br> [linkurl3]<br> [linktext4]<br>   [linkurl4]<br> [linktext5]<br> [linkurl5]  </blockquote>   the storage for the urls/files will be in a table <strong>[documents]</strong> with fields:<br>   <blockquote>    [baseidentityid] - references the id field from [base] table<br>   [docindex] - each base record can have 1 - 5 of the urls filled in.    this is to know which url # it is.<br> [mimetype]<br> [url]<br>   [text]<br> [content]<br> [processed] - bit - will pull the url data at   a later time  this flags that.  </blockquote>   i m using an instead of trigger on my [base] table.  these records can be updated so we re keeping archived data in the table.  the trigger looks at what we re inserting  flags the existing versions as old  and inserts this new base record as the currentversion.    in this trigger  i d now like to insert into the [documents] table a new row based on each of the 5 pairs of url data  passing in the [base] id identity field for the [baseidentityid] in the documents table  and a 1 for [docindex] for linkurl1  2 for [docindex] for linkurl2  etc...    having a hard time visualizing how i will do that exactly.  any suggestions   i m trying to avoid using cursors as i could have a pretty large collection of base records to insert.    thanks.,sql

is select distinct bad practice when you know a join will produce duplicates   on occasion when building a query i know i will have duplicates due to one of the joined tables. is it better practice to remove those duplicates using a more rigorous join statement and/or using select distinct in a subquery  rather than using a select distinct statement for the entire thing     for example:   <pre><code>select pl.station  pl.part_number  pd.description from sample_db.part_locator pl left join prod_sample_db.part_detail pd on pl.part_number = pd.part_number where pl.part_number =  4077968  and pl.station =  atl   4 rows returned. </code></pre>   <a href= https://i.stack.imgur.com/o29dg.png  rel= nofollow noreferrer ><img src= https://i.stack.imgur.com/o29dg.png  alt= enter image description here ></a> <br>    obviously i could just use a select distinct to get unique values:   <pre><code>select distinct pl.station  pl.part_number  pd.description from sample_db.part_locator pl left join prod_sample_db.part_detail pd on pl.part_number = pd.part_number where pl.part_number =  4077968  and pl.station =  atl   1 row returned. </code></pre>   but is this better form (making the join more specific)    <pre><code>select pl.station  pl.part_number  pd.description from sample_db.part_locator pl left join prod_sample_db.part_detail pd on pl.part_number = pd.part_number and pl.bin_number = pd.bin_number     &lt;--- additional join criteria where pl.part_number =  4077968  and pl.station =  atl   1 row returned. </code></pre>   or this:   <pre><code>select pl.station  pl.part_number  pd.description from sample_db.part_locator pl left join  (     select distinct     &lt;--- add distinct statement in subquery     part_number      description     from     prod_sample_db.part_detail ) pd on pl.part_number = pd.part_number where pl.part_number =  4077968  and pl.station =  atl   1 row returned. </code></pre>   what is considered best practice,sql

can you return from a method early in an objective-c   i m doing some networking stuff in one of my methods and i would like the method to <code>return no</code> and stop executing early if one of the internal calls returns an error  a bit like break for loops. is this possible     imo it would produce cleaner code rather than using a bool flag and having  should i continue executing this code   if statements all over the place; and then finally at the end of the method returning yes or no based on the flag.    any thoughts are much appreciated!,objective-c
.net system.missingmethodexception  i am trying to write a very simple program to evaluate a 3rd party library. i have added all the necessary .dll references to my project and have written the following code (boiler plate removed) which attempts to use the controller class in the 3rd party library:   <pre><code>controller controller = new controller( 192.168.42.190   controller.cpu.s7300   0.2 );  controller.connect();  tag mytag = new tag();  controller.readtag(mytag);  controller.disconnect(); </code></pre>   this code builds just fine and intellisense agrees that all is well. when i run this code however the line <code>controller.readtag(mytag);</code> causes a system.missingmethodexception.    i m quite new to .net and am confused as to why i am able to build the code above  use intellisense to view all the methods and properties on the controller class (including readtag) only to have the code fail at runtime.    any clarification would be greatly appreciated. thanks.,.net

applying for .net jobs as a  self learner   i have recently started applying for .net jobs. i currently work in a sales role with a large telco. i found out quite late that i like programming and as such bought my house and made commitments that mean college is not an option.    what i would like to know is  is it harder to get a junior job as a self learner  i have gotten a few enquiries regarding my c.v but nothing concrete yet. i try to be involved in projects as i get the chance and tend to put up any worthwhile projects as i develop them.    some examples of my work are:    a xaml lexer and parser: <a href= http://www.xlight.mendhak.com  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://www.xlight.mendhak.com</a>    a font obfuscation tool: <a href= http://www.silverlightforums.com/showthread.php 1516-font-obsfucation-tool-alpha  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://www.silverlightforums.com/showthread.php 1516-font-obsfucation-tool-alpha</a>    a tagger for m4a: <a href= http://projectaudiophile.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/list/changesets  rel= nofollow noreferrer >http://projectaudiophile.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/list/changesets</a>    i  of course think that these are great examples of my work but that is my opinion based on self learning. the other query is how much should i actually know  i ve never used linked lists but i know that strings are immutable and i understand what that means. i am only touching on t-sql but i understand things like how properties function in il (as two standard methods :) ). i suppose i understand a lot of concepts but specific features need some looking up to implement as i may not know the syntax off the top of my head.,.net

c++ sleep time for alphabet equivalent numerical code  <strong>2nd edit details added with change code</strong>    i have an alphabet equivalent numerical code in array of string that i want to be output when a word or sentence is input. here is my c++ code for that. it gets user input &amp; output a beep for equivalent time for all numerical digit for all alphabets in a full word like morse code would do. basically i need this for my embedded application but 1st i want to have it working in typical c then i move it to embedded.    currently it works like e.g. alphabet  i  has numerical code 24  when executed &amp;  i  is given as input  it beeps first two times with a sleep time of inner_loop between those i.e. 450. then it sleeps for outer_loop i.e. 700 and then beeps for 4 times with inner_loop sleep time. so it is possible to recognize that it beeps 2 times  wait &amp; then beeps 4 times  i.e. transmitting  24  that is code for  i . if i input  ii  it does same twice i.e. starts beep for 2nd  i  after inner_loop sleep time so code appears like 2424. it s not possible to recognize it was was 24 &amp; again 24. it should work like 24 read as described before than a looooong wait &amp; 24 again raed  so user may recognize code for two alphabets i.e.  ii  or any other combination.      what i want it to introduce a third_sleep time that occurs between any two alphabets of same word so that each alphabet code can be read separately. currently it s only between numerical code of same alphabet.             here is my code so far:         <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;sstream&gt; #include &lt;windows.h&gt;  using namespace std;  string texttopattern(char c) { //hello world again //125-15-123-123-135 1346-135-1235-123-145 1-1245-1-24-1345      string alphabet =  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwqyz ; //osv     string code[] = { 1   12   14   145    15    124    1245                          125    24    245    13    123    134                          1345    135    1234    12345    1235    234    2345                          136    1236    1346    13456    1356    12346 };     int index = alphabet.find(c);     if(index!=-1)         return code[index];     else         return    ; }  int main() {     const int outer_sleep = 700                inner_sleep = 450;     int n;     string ord;     getline(cin  ord);     string code=  ;     for(int i=0; i&lt;ord.length(); i++)     {         code += texttopattern(ord[i]);     }      for(int i = 0; i&lt;code.length(); i++)     {         n = code[i] -  0 ;         for(int j=0; j&lt;n; j++)         {             cout&lt;&lt; \a ;             sleep(inner_sleep);         }         sleep(outer_sleep);     }     return 0; } </code></pre>,c++

styling child elements depending on html order without css ids or class  there are two scenarios possible. firstly the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> could come before the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag    <pre><code>&lt;a&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;img&gt;&lt;/img&gt; &lt;a&gt; </code></pre>   and secondly it could come after   <pre><code>&lt;a&gt;    &lt;img&gt;&lt;/img&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a&gt; </code></pre>   i was wondering if there is any way to target the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element in both situations and style them differently.    i would like to position the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> to the left if it comes before the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or right if it comes after.    i need to this be without adding any css classes / ids to any elements.    any help is appreciated.,css
recalculate sum of all select values on change  i m trying to implement <a href= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7249757/jquery-sum-values-from-different-divs-with-same-classes >this question</a> s answer in to my code  but i m hitting issues with the recalculation.    i have three dynamically-created <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> dropdowns that hold values from 0 to 25. i have given these a <code>.select-control</code> class so that i can access them easier. code for each is as follows:   <pre><code>&lt;select name= amount_1  class= form-control select-control  required&gt;     &lt;option disabled selected value=  &gt;no. of vouchers&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option value= 0 &gt;0&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option value= 1 &gt;1&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option value= 2 &gt;2&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option value= 3 &gt;3&lt;/option&gt;     ...     &lt;option value= 21 &gt;21&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option value= 22 &gt;22&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option value= 23 &gt;23&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option value= 24 &gt;24&lt;/option&gt;     &lt;option value= 25 &gt;25&lt;/option&gt; &lt;/select&gt; </code></pre>   the other two <code>&lt;selects&gt;</code> are named <code>amount_2</code> and <code>amount_3</code> respectively.    when one of their values changes  i need to recalculate the total sum of the selected options. this is my (non-working) code as it stands now. any push in the right direction would be appreciated.   <pre><code>var total = 0; $( .select-control ).change(function() {     $( .select-control ).each(function() {         total += parseint(this.value);     });     alert(total); }); </code></pre>   the alert is only for testing purposes. once working  i will simply update a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element with the total.    here is a <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/3c4fxpa5/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >jsfiddle</a>.    <strong>edit:</strong> after answers  here is a working <a href= http://jsfiddle.net/3c4fxpa5/2/  rel= nofollow noreferrer >jsfiddle</a>.,jquery
why is my code giving incorrect results for big numbers   i am trying to solve this task:   <blockquote>    in this exercise you will write a program that estimates the value of π. pretend that we are looking at a dartboard in the picture above. if the square is 2units wide and 2 units high  the radius of the circle within the square is 1 unit. then the area of the circle is  π*r2 = π*12 = π. the area of the square will be 2*2 = 4.        the estimation of π will work by randomly “throwing darts” at the dartboard. we will assume that every dart will hit the board but the location of that strike will be random so some darts will land inside the circle and some will land outside the circle. the calculation of π is then the ratio of the number of darts that land inside the circle to the total number of darts  multiplied by 4. note that as we increase the number of darts used in the simulation  the accuracy improves.        follow the steps to complete the program:       <ol>   <li> declare variables that represent x  y coordinates of a dart  the distance of the dart from the origin  the number of darts that land inside the circle  and the total number of darts.  </li>   <li> read in the total number of darts (n) from the user and create an instance of the random class. </li>   <li> create a loop that runs n times. inside the loop  you will use the nextfloat() method of the random class to create x  y coordinates randomly  and then compute the distance of the dart from the origin. determine whether the dart lands inside or outside of the circle. </li>   <li> compute π using the estimation algorithm. </li>   <li> run the program with increasing numbers from 100 to 100 000 000 and observe the accuracy of π. </li>   </ol> </blockquote>   here is my program i wrote. it works to some extent  but results seems incorrect for input like 100000. can anyone explain what s wrong with my code     <pre><code>import java.util.scanner; import java.util.random;  public class calculatepi {     public static void main(string[] args) {         double x;         double y;         double distance;         int i = 0;         float inside = 0;         float outside = 0;         float totaldarts;          scanner scan = new scanner(system.in);         random random = new random();          system.out.println( enter the number of darts:  );         totaldarts = scan.nextfloat();          for (i = 1; i &lt; totaldarts; i++) {             x = math.abs(random.nextfloat() % 2);             y = math.abs(random.nextfloat() % 2);              distance = (float) math.sqrt(math.pow(x - 1  2)                     + math.pow(y - 1  2));              if (distance &lt;= 1)                 inside++;             else                 outside++;         }          system.out.println( total number of arrows inside circle:  + inside);         system.out.println( estimated value of pie:                   + (((inside * 4) / (double) totaldarts)));      }  } </code></pre>,java

how to make a subview automatically resize with its superview   i have a view which contains one sub-view; this sub-view itself contains another sub-view  which is meant to be slightly smaller than its superview.    i am creating the first subview full-screen size then shrinking it to a very small size on the screen.  when the subview is tapped  i animate it from its small size to full-screen.    the problem is that my second subview never resizes itself during this animation - it is always rendered full-size and overflows the bounds of its superview.    is there a simple way to get a subview to keep itself sized proportionally as its superview changes size,iphone

is it safe to call dict.__init__ on already populated dictionary   i have a class that inherits from the built in <code>dict</code> class. it used to look a bit like:   <pre><code>class awesomedictionary(dict):     def __init__(self  *args  **args):         self[ hello ] =  world          i = {}         dict.__init__(i  *args  **kargs)         self.update(i) </code></pre>   i implemented it like that with a temporary dictionary because i thought <code>__init__</code> would create a brand new dictionary or at least clear it.    i only recently realized that you can do something like this in the python interpreter with no problems:   <pre><code>f = { hi :56   67 :89} dict.__init__(f  **{ h :67}) print f #you get:  { 67 : 89   h : 67   hi : 56} </code></pre>   and if you specify the same field:   <pre><code>f = { hi :56   67 :89} dict.__init__(f  **{ hi :34}) print f #you get:  { 67 : 89   hi : 34} </code></pre>   so  in that case  it would appear that <code>__init__</code> is acting the same as <code>.update</code>.     is there a particular reason why this is the case and can i expect this to be consistent across implementations and versions     on a similar note  is there any purpose for calling <code>.update</code> on a regular dictionary other than perhaps code cleainliness and readability (which is a perfectly fine reason mind you  i was just wondering if that is the only reason)     oh and i know i could just leave it as is and do an update for peace of mind  but it feels quite inefficient if you are doing the same thing twice.    i apologize if this is a silly question.    thanks for your time.,python

c unknown-size structure  i am writing an app with the following dynamic config structure:   <pre><code>typedef struct {     char apphash[41];     char filenames_count;     char * filename[64]; } config; </code></pre>   but this code is wrong  i can t figure out how to copy data from and to c->filename[0] properly; c is a pointer to config structure  allocated dynamically like   <pre><code>config * c = (config *) malloc( 42 + 64 * 2 ) // alloc for 2 filenames. can realloc() later. </code></pre>   it segfaults if i use something like <code>strcpy(c-&gt;filename[0]  file1.txt )</code>.    can someone please help me with this     currently  i m using direct address calculation  like   <pre><code>strcpy(     (char*)      ((unsigned long) c + 42 /* apphash + filenames_count */ +      64 * 0 /* first item */ )       file1.txt  ); </code></pre>   and it works of course.     you see  i m more of assembly programmer than of c  but i d like this code to be more human-readable. this code looks that bad because i m newcomer in c.   <hr>   oh  i gave a bad description of the situation. sorry for that :(<br> the real code looks like:   <pre><code>config * c = (config*) malloc( 42 + 64 * 2 ); // we may realloc() it later if we are going to add more filenames.  // failing example how i do copy one default filename strcpy(c-&gt;filename[0]  file1.txt );  // working example (i386) strcpy((char*)((unsigned long) c + 42 + 64 * 0)  file1.txt ); </code></pre>   i am using fully static structure type because it is going to be loaded directly from a file next time. that s why i can t really use pointers inside the structure  i need real data to be placed there.<br> i do check all lengths  no bofs in real code  i just omitted all that stuff here.    i still didn t find a good solution to this.    thanks again and sorry for bad question information.,c
how does a for loop allow redeclaration of a variable   this:   <pre><code>int j = 1; int j = 2; console.writeline(j.tostring()); </code></pre>   .. produces a compile error:   <blockquote>    a local variable named  j  is already defined in this scope  </blockquote>   yet this works fine:   <pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {   int j = i;   console.writeline(j.tostring()); } </code></pre>   why       how does the loop simultaneous retain values from each iteration whilst being able to redeclare a variable with the same name in the same scope,c#
objective-c for loop to set variable text value  i have two things that seem should be easy and i am betting they are easy but this is my first objective-c program ever so its not coming to me easy like it would in my native perl. both examples are pretty much the same but i am thinking since one is using <code>@synthesize</code> it may be very different.    example 1   <pre><code>// what works @synthesize display0 = _display0; @synthesize display1 = _display1; @synthesize display2 = _display2; @synthesize display3 = _display3;  // what i would like to do: for (int i=0; i&lt;4; i++) {     @synthesize display$i = _display$i; } </code></pre>   example 2   <pre><code>// works - (ibaction)clearpressed {     self.display0.text = @ 0 ;     self.display1.text = @ 0 ;     self.display2.text = @ 0 ;     self.display3.text = @ 0 ; }  // what i would like to see - (ibaction)clearpressed {     for (int i=0; i&lt;4; i++) {         self.display$i.text = @ 0 ;     } } </code></pre>   any help getting me in the right direction would be great!,objective-c

should i return from within a foreach loop  i see plenty of code examples where the user is returning from within a foreach loop  but is it bad form to do this   does it leave any orphaned references  for example     here s an example:   <pre><code>$array = array(1  2  4  8  16);     foreach ($array as $value) {   if ($value == 8) return true;  } return false; </code></pre>   edit: this is quite different from its supposedly duplicate question  simply by the fact that it focuses on the <code>return</code> instruction  not the <code>break</code>  <code>continue</code>  <code>goto</code>  or any other instruction.  users who are searching for the answer to this question will no necessarily search for the supposed alternatives.  in my case  it didn t event occur to me to think them through.  even if i had i would not have come up with an exhaustive list.,php

append from own object  how can i just append an object to another in the same object  like this:   <pre><code>&lt;div class= foo &gt;   &lt;div class= bar &gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class= lorem &gt;bar&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class= foo &gt;   &lt;div class= bar &gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class= lorem &gt;bar&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre>   now i will but the first div into the second one  so like:   <pre><code>$( .bar ).appendto( .lorem ); </code></pre>   here the foo will appear on every bar on the website. in this example it will appear twice (<a href= http://codepen.io/sukrams/pen/zqgeyb  rel= nofollow >like this</a>). is there a possibility to jump just the foo into the .lorem-div which is in the same container     i tried it with something like <code>$(this).$( .bar ).appendto(this).( .lorem )</code> but it doesn t work.,jquery
